<H3><a name="3.11">3.11 Case Statements</a></H3>

A case  statement selects for execution one of a number of alternative
sequences of  statements: the  alternative selected  is defined by the
value of  an expression.  Each sequence of statements is preceded by a
list of choices defining the values for which that alternative must be
selected. The  main criteria  in the  design of the case statement are
reliability and generality.
<p>
For reliability,  the compiler  must be given the opportunity to check
for the accidental omission of some alternatives. For that reason, Ada
requires that  all possible  values of  the type of the discriminating
expression be  provided for  in the  choices. This rule is weakened if
the discriminating  expression is  a name whose subtype is static: the
choices that must be provided are then all the values of this subtype.
Finally, a  qualified expression  can be used to restrict the possible
choices, and a final choice others may be used to represent all values
not previously specified.
<p>
As an example consider the declarations
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DAY is (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN);
subtype WORKDAY  is DAY range MON .. FRI;
subtype RESTDAY  is DAY range SAT  .. SUN;

TODAY : DAY;
START  : WORKDAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
With the  above declarations  all values  of the type DAY (the type of
TODAY) must appear in one selection, as in
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when MON | TUE | WED | THU | FRI =&gt;  WORK;
  when SAT | SUN =&gt;  REST;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This could have been written in the equivalent form
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when MON | TUE | WED | THU | FRI =&gt; WORK;
  when others =&gt; REST;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If in  a given  context it is known that the case discriminant belongs
to a  given subtype,  a case statement with a qualified expression may
be used.  Only the  values of  the corresponding subtype can appear in
the selections.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case WORKDAY'(TODAY) is
  when MON | WED | FRI =&gt;  LATE;
  when TUE  | THU =&gt;  EARLY;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Should the  value of  TODAY not  belong to  the subtype  WORKDAY  (for
example if  TODAY = SAT), then the exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR would be
raised by  the evaluation  of the  qualified expression.  This  cannot
arise in  the following  example, which uses the fact that the subtype
of START is static:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case START is
  when MON  | WED | FRI =&gt;  LATE;
  when TUE   | THU =&gt;  EARLY;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The  other  main  criterion  in  the  design  of  case  statements  is
generality: the syntax of selections should accommodate all situations
that are  likely to  arise, given  that the  case discriminant  has  a
discrete type.  Hence it  should permit  ranges as  well as  lists  of
values.
<p>
Thus the  first example  above is  more likely  to  be  written  using
ranges:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when MON .. FRI     =&gt;  WORK;
  when SAT  .. SUN    =&gt;  REST;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
or (better) using the subtype names:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when WORKDAY  =&gt;  WORK;
  when RESTDAY  =&gt;  REST;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Such ranges  and subtype  names are very useful for case choices. They
avoid long  lists that  can be  tedious to  read and  therefore error-
prone.
<p>
In many ways a case statement is similar to an array of statements and
this is  somewhat reflected  in the syntax. For example we may compute
the opposite of a given direction by means of a case statement:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DIRECTION is (NORTH, WEST, SOUTH, EAST);
COURSE :  DIRECTION;
BACK    :  DIRECTION;
  ...          -- a value is given to COURSE
case COURSE is
  when NORTH =&gt;  BACK :=  SOUTH;
  when WEST  =&gt;  BACK :=  EAST;
  when SOUTH =&gt;  BACK :=  NORTH;
  when EAST  =&gt;  BACK :=  WEST;
end case;
  -- now BACK is the direction opposite to COURSE
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Another formulation  of this  computation uses  an array of directions
declared as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
INVERSE : constant array(DIRECTION) of DIRECTION :=
                   (NORTH =&gt;  SOUTH,
                    WEST  =&gt;  EAST,
                    SOUTH =&gt;  NORTH,
                    EAST  =&gt;  WEST);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
and the assignment statement
<p>
<PRE>    BACK :=  INVERSE(COURSE);
</PRE><p>
As can  be seen  from the  above example, the conceptual similarity is
actually  reflected  in  the  similarity  of  the  syntaxes  for  case
statements and for array aggregates.
<p>
A very  important diagnostic facility that the compiler should provide
is the  listing of  all values  of the discriminating type that do not
appear in  the  listed  choices.  For  an  incomplete  (and  therefore
incorrect) case statement, the compiler has the information and should
provide it  to  the  programmer.  In  the  absence  of  this  kind  of
diagnostic, it might be quite difficult for the programmer to discover
missing values for an enumeration type with a large number of values.
<p>
Case  statements  are  conventionally  implemented  with  an  implicit
transfer table.  This table  will generally contain one place for each
possible value  of the  discriminating type.  Quite often  however, if
some of  the alternatives  include null  statements, the  compiler may
optimize the  code generated, by using a shorter table and an explicit
range check. As an example
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when SAT  =&gt;  SHOP;
  when SUN  =&gt;  SLEEP;
  when others    =&gt;  null;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
may be compiled to produce code equivalent to
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
if TODAY in RESTDAY then
  case RESTDAY'(TODAY) is            -- no check needed
    when SAT  =&gt;  SHOP;
    when SUN  =&gt;  SLEEP;
  end case;
end if;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
thus leading  to a  two-place transfer table. Finally, case statements
with very  sparse selections  or with  ranges  as  selections  can  be
compiled as  equivalent if  statements. Thus  for our first example we
may have:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
if TODAY in WORKDAY then
  WORK;
else
  REST;
end if;
</pre></td></tr></table>
