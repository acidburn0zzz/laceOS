including nonoverlapping parts of the same object, are <I>independently 
addressable</I>, they can be manipulated concurrently by two different 
tasks without synchronization. Normally, any two nonoverlapping objects 
are independently addressable. However, if packing, record layout, or

Pack. If two objects are independently addressable, the implementation 
should allocate them in such a way that each can be written by the hardware 
without writing the other. For example, unless the user asks for it, 
it is generally not feasible to choose a bit-packed representation on 
a machine without an atomic bit field insertion instruction, because 
there might be tasks that update neighboring subcomponents concurrently, 
and locking operations on all subcomponents is generally not a good idea.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">1.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Even if packing or one of the other above-mentioned 
aspects is specified, subcomponents should still be updated independently

for the same protected object;&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">9.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>The underlying principle here 
is that for one action to &ldquo;signal&rdquo; a second, the second action 
has to follow a potentially blocking operation, whose blocking is dependent 
on the first action in some way. Protected procedures are not potentially 
blocking, so they can only be &quot;signalers,&quot; they cannot be signaled. 
</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">9.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>Protected subprogram calls 
are not defined to signal one another, which means that such calls alone 
cannot be used to synchronize access to shared data outside of a protected 
object.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">9.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>The point of this distinction 
is so that on multiprocessors with inconsistent caches, the caches only 
need to be refreshed at the beginning of an entry body, and forced out 
at the end of an entry body or protected procedure that leaves an entry 
open. Protected function calls, and protected subprogram calls for entryless 
protected objects do not require full cache consistency. Entryless protected 
objects are intended to be treated roughly like atomic objects &mdash; 
each operation is indivisible with respect to other operations (unless 
both are reads), but such operations cannot be used to synchronize access 
to other nonvolatile shared variables.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV Class="paranum">11</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>erroneous 
execution (cause)</I> [partial]}</SPAN> <A NAME="I4288"></A>Given an 
action of assigning to an object, and an action of reading or updating 
a part of the same object (or of a neighboring object if the two are 
not independently addressable), then the execution of the actions is 
erroneous unless the actions are <I>sequential</I>. <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>sequential

<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>One action signals the other;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">13</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>Both actions occur as part of the 
execution of the same task;&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">13.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>Any two actions of the same task 
are sequential, even if one does not signal the other because they can 
be executed in an &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; (but necessarily equivalent 
to some &ldquo;sequential&rdquo;) order.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">14</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>Both actions occur as part of protected 
actions on the same protected object, and at most one of the actions 
is part of a call on a protected function of the protected object.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">14.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>Because actions within protected 
actions do not always imply signaling, we have to mention them here explicitly 
to make sure that actions occurring within different protected actions 
of the same protected object are sequential with respect to one another 
(unless both are part of calls on protected functions).&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">14.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>It doesn't matter whether 
or not the variable being assigned is actually a subcomponent of the 
protected object; globals can be safely updated from within the bodies 
of protected procedures or entries.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV Class="Normal">A <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Atomic or Atomic_Components may also be used to ensure that certain reads 
and updates are sequential &mdash; see <A HREF="AA-C-6.html">C.6</A>. 
</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">15.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>If two actions are &ldquo;sequential&rdquo; 
it is known that their executions don't overlap in time, but it is not 
necessarily specified which occurs first. For example, all actions of 
a single task are sequential, even though the exact order of execution 
is not fully specified for all constructs.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">15.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>Note that if two assignments 
to the same variable are sequential, but neither signals the other, then 
the program is not erroneous, but it is not specified which assignment 
ultimately prevails. Such a situation usually corresponds to a programming 
mistake, but in some (rare) cases, the order makes no difference, and 
for this reason this situation is not considered erroneous nor even a 
bounded error. In Ada 83, this was considered an &ldquo;incorrect order 
dependence&rdquo; if the &ldquo;effect&rdquo; of the program was affected, 
but &ldquo;effect&rdquo; was never fully defined. In Ada 95, this situation 
represents a potential nonportability, and a friendly compiler might 
want to warn the programmer about the situation, but it is not considered 
an error. An example where this would come up would be in gathering statistics 
as part of referencing some information, where the assignments associated 
with statistics gathering don't need to be ordered since they are just 
accumulating aggregate counts, sums, products, etc.&nbsp;</DIV>
