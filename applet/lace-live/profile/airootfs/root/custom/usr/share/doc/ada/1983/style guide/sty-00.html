<h3><a name="preface">Preface</a></h3>
This version of Ada Quality and Style: Guidelines for Professional Programmers
was updated under contract to the Department of Defense (DoD) Ada Joint
Program Office (AJPO).  Considerable effort was placed on improving the
coverage of portability and reusability issues, so the majority of changes can
be found in those chapters.  A new chapter has been included to address
performance issues.<P>
The most visible change, however, involves the capitalization issue.  The 
guideline has not changed, but the instantiation now recommends mixed-case 
identifiers with upper-case abbreviations and lower-case reserved words.  
Several informal surveys and the general consensus of the reviewers showed 
strong support for this change.<P>
The <a href="sty-10.html">Complete Examples chapter</a> includes two new examples which highlight 
portability and the use of tasking.  Each of the examples in this chapter are 
intended to be compilable and executable.<P>
The Consortium invites comments on this guidebook to continue enhancing its
quality and usefulness. We will consider suggestions for current guidelines
and areas for future expansion. Examples that highlight particular points are
most helpful.<P>
