<H3><a name="7.1">7.1     Fundamentals</a></H3>
This section introduces some generally applicable principles of writing  
portable Ada programs. It includes guidelines about the assumptions you should  
make with respect to a number of Ada features and their implementations and  
guidelines about the use of other Ada features to ensure maximum portability.

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Make considered assumptions about the support provided for the  
following on potential target platforms: 
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>Number of bits available for type <CODE>Integer</CODE> (range constraints). 
<li>Number of decimal digits of precision available for floating point  
types. 
<li>Number of bits available for fixed-point types (delta and range 
constraints). 
<li>Number of characters per line of source text. 
<li>Number of bits for <CODE>Universal_Integer</CODE> expressions. 
<li>Number of seconds for the range of <CODE>Duration</CODE>. 
<li>Number of milliseconds for <CODE>Duration'Small</CODE>.  
</UL>
</UL>

<H4>instantiation</H4>
These are minimum values (or minimum precision in the case of
<CODE>Duration'Small</CODE>)  
that a project or application might assume that an implementation provides.  
There is no guarantee that a given implementation provides more than the  
minimum, so these would be treated by the project or application as maximum  
values also.
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>16 bits available for type <CODE>Integer (-2**15 .. 2**15 - 1)</CODE>. 
<li>6 decimal digits of precision available for floating point types. 
<li>32 bits available for fixed-point types. 
<li>72 characters per line of source text. 
<li>16 bits for <CODE>Universal_Integer</CODE> expressions. 
<li><CODE>-86_400 .. 86_400</CODE> seconds (1 day) for the range of
<CODE>Duration</CODE> (as  
specified in <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-09-06.html#9.6">9.6 (4) of Department of Defense 1983)</a>) 
<li>20 milliseconds for <CODE>Duration'Small</CODE> (as specified in <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-09-06.html#9.6">9.6 (4) of  
Department of Defense 1983)</a>). 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Some assumptions must be made with respect to certain implementation dependent  
values. The exact values assumed should cover the majority of the target  
equipment of interest. Choosing the lowest common denominator for values  
improves portability.

<H4>note</H4>
Of the microcomputers currently available for incorporation within embedded 
systems, 16-bit and 32-bit processors are prevalent. Although 4-bit and 8-bit 
machines are still available, their limited memory addressing capabilities 
make them unsuited to support Ada programs of any size. Using current 
representation schemes, 6 decimal digits of floating point accuracy implies a 
representation mantissa at least 21 bits wide, leaving 11 bits for exponent 
and sign within a 32-bit representation. This correlates with the data widths 
of floating point hardware currently available for the embedded systems 
market. A 32-bit minimum on fixed-point numbers correlates with the accuracy 
and storage requirements of floating point numbers.<P>
The 72-column limit on source lines in the example is an unfortunate hold-over 
from the days of Hollerith punch cards with sequence numbers. There may still  
be machinery and software used in manipulating source code that are bound to  
assumptions about this maximum line length. The 16-bit example for 
<CODE>Universal_Integer</CODE> expressions matches that for <CODE>Integer</CODE> storage.<P>
The values for the range and accuracy of values of the predefined type 
<CODE>Duration</CODE> are the limits expressed in the
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-09-06.html#9.6">Ada Language Reference Manual 
(Department of Defense 1983, Section 9.6)</a>. You should not expect an implementation 
to provide a wider range or a finer granularity.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The Ada model may not match exactly with the underlying hardware, so some  
compromises may have been made in the implementation. Check to see if they  
could affect your program. Particular implementations may do &quot;better&quot; than the 
Ada model requires while some others may be just minimally acceptable.  
Arithmetic is generally implemented with a precision higher than the storage  
capacity (this is implied by the Ada type model for floating point). Different  
implementations may behave differently on the same underlying hardware.<P>

Explicitly commenting each breach of portability will raise its visibility and  
aid in the porting process. A description of the non-portable feature's 
expectations covers the common case where vendor documentation of the original  
implementation is not available to the person performing the porting process.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use only a parameterless procedure as the main program. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual
(Department of Defense 1983)</a> places very few  
requirements on the main subprogram.  Assume the simplest case will increase  
portability. That is, assume you may only use a parameterless procedure as a  
main program.<P>
Some operating systems are capable of acquiring and interpreting returned 
integer values near zero from a function, but many others cannot. Further, 
many real-time, embedded systems will not be designed to terminate, so a 
function or a procedure having parameters with modes
<CODE>out</CODE> or <CODE>in out</CODE> will be 
inappropriate to such applications.<P>
This leaves procedures with in parameters. Although some operating systems can 
pass parameters in to a program as it starts, others cannot. Also, an 
implementation may not be able to perform type checking on such parameters 
even if the surrounding environment is capable of providing them.

<H4>note</H4>
Real-time, embedded applications may not have an &quot;operator&quot; initiating the 
program to supply the parameters, in which case it would be more appropriate 
for the program to have been compiled with a package containing the 
appropriate constant values or for the program to read the necessary values 
from switch settings or a downloaded auxiliary file. In any case, the 
variation in surrounding initiating environments is far too great to depend 
upon the kind of last-minute (program) parameterization implied by 
(subprogram) parameters to the main subprogram.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="7.1.5">7.1.5   Encapsulating Implementation Dependencies</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Create packages specifically designed to isolate hardware and  
implementation dependencies and designed so that their specification will not  
change when porting. 
<li>Clearly indicate the objectives if machine or solution efficiency is  
the reason for hardware or implementation dependent code. 
<li>For the packages that hide implementation dependencies, maintain  
different package bodies for different target environments. 
<li>Isolate interrupt receiving tasks into implementation dependent  
packages. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
See <a href="#7.1.3">Guideline 7.1.3</a>.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Encapsulating hardware and implementation dependencies in a package allows the 
remainder of the code to ignore them and thus to be fully portable. It also 
localizes the dependencies, making it clear exactly which parts of the code 
may need to change when porting the program.<P>
Some implementation-dependent features may be used to achieve particular 
performance or efficiency objectives. Commenting these objectives ensures that  
the programmer can find an appropriate way to achieve them when porting to a  
different implementation, or explicitly recognize that they cannot be achieved.<P>
Interrupt entries are implementation-dependent features that may not be 
supported (e.g., VAX Ada uses pragmas to assign system traps to &quot;normal&quot; 
rendezvous). However, interrupt entries cannot be avoided in most embedded  
real-time systems and it is reasonable to assume that they are supported by an 
Ada implementation. The value for an interrupt is implementation-defined. 
Isolate it.

<H4>note</H4>
Ada can be used to write machine-dependent programs that take advantage of an 
implementation in a manner consistent with the Ada model, but which make  
particular choices where Ada allows implementation freedom. These machine  
dependencies should be treated in the same way as any other implementation  
dependent features of the code.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid the use of vendor supplied packages. 
<li> Avoid the use of features added to the predefined packages that are 
not specified in the language definition. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Vendor-added features are not likely to be provided by other implementations. 
Even if a majority of vendors eventually provide similar additional features, 
they are unlikely to have identical formulations. Indeed, different vendors 
may use the same formulation for (semantically) entirely different features.<P>
exceptions<P>
There are many types of applications that require the use of these features. 
Examples include: multilingual systems that standardize on a vendor's file 
system, applications that are closely integrated with vendor products (i.e., 
user interfaces), and embedded systems for performance reasons. Isolate the 
use of these features into packages.<P>
