<H2>CHAPTER 10: Separate Compilation and Libraries</H2>

<H3><a name="10.2">10.2 Presentation of the Separate Compilation Facility</a></H3>

A complete  program is  a collection of compilation units submitted to
the compiler  individually or  in  batches  (called  compilations).  A
compilation unit  is either  a library  unit or  a secondary  unit.  A
library unit can be:
<ul>
<li>a package declaration

<li>a subprogram declaration

<li>a generic declaration or instantiation
</ul>

A secondary  unit, as the name indicates, is always related to another
compilation unit: A secondary unit can be the body of a library unit -
<ul>
<li>a package body

<li>a subprogram body

<li>the body of a generic unit
</ul>


or,  as we  shall see  later, a  secondary unit  can be a subunit of
another compilation  unit (the  latter being  either a library unit or
another secondary unit).
<p>
Each compilation  unit may  have a  context clause  at the  beginning,
containing with  clauses that mention the names of other library units
that the  compilation unit needs. Thus, although compilation units can
be submitted individually to a compiler, they can depend on each other
as  indicated by <CODE>with</CODE> clauses. For this reason the compilation units
that form a given program are said to belong to a program library.
<p>
Traditionally,  one   distinguishes  two   main  styles   of   program
development:  top-down   (or  hierarchical)  program  development  and
bottom-up  program  development.  The  separate  compilation  facility
provided in Ada supports both styles, as well as intermediate forms.

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.1">10.2.1 Bottom-Up Program Development</a></H3>

In  this   style  of  program  development  we  may  have  programmers
developing libraries of generally usable packages.
<p>
Each generally usable package can be separately compiled and therefore
made available  in the  program library.  The  specification  and  the
package body  (if any)  can both be compilation units, and they can be
submitted either  in the  same  or  in  different  compilations  (each
compilation is a succession of compilation units).
<p>
Some of  these packages  do not  depend on  any  outside  information,
except  perhaps  that  of  the  predefined  environment  (the  package
STANDARD, which  defines types  such  as  BOOLEAN  and  INTEGER).  The
package declarations  for METRIC_CONVERSIONS  and WORK_DATA  given  in
<a href="ratl-09.html#9">Chapter 9</a> fall into this category.
<p>
More generally,  packages may depend on information that is defined by
other packages  of the  program library.  For example  an application-
level input-output  package may  depend on  a more  basic input-output
package;  similarly   a  surveying   package  could   depend  on  this
application-level input-output  package and  on another  package  that
defines trigonometric functions.
<p>
As an  example of  a compilation  unit that  depends on  other library
units consider  the following  procedure,  which  presents  a  (naive)
solution of  quadratic equations. The compilation unit starts with the
context clause:
<PRE>    with TEXT_IO, REAL_OPERATIONS;  use REAL_OPERATIONS;</PRE>
<p>
The  with   clause   specifies   that   the   packages   TEXT_IO   and
REAL_OPERATIONS are both needed. The use clause for the latter package
achieves direct  visibility of  the entities  declared in  its visible
part -  the type  REAL, the (nested) package REAL_IO, and the function
SQRT:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with TEXT_IO, REAL_OPERATIONS;  use REAL_OPERATIONS;
procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION is
  A, B, C, D :  REAL;
  use REAL_IO;    -- To see GET and PUT for the type REAL
  use TEXT_IO;    -- To see PUT for strings, and NEW_LINE
begin
  GET(A);  GET(B);  GET(C);
  D :=  B&#42;&#42;2 - 4.0&#42;A&#42;C;
  if D &lt; 0.0 then
    PUT("IMAGINARY ROOTS.");
  else
    PUT("REAL ROOTS :  X1 = ");
    PUT((-B - SQRT(D))/(2.0&#42;A));
    PUT (" X2 = ");
    PUT((-B + SQRT(D))/(2.0&#42;A));
  end if;
  NEW_LINE;
end QUADRATIC_EQUATION;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Although the  programmer who  wrote QUADRATIC_EQUATION  might think he
had finished  at this  stage, the  complete program includes more than
this single  procedure. Thus,  it is  not going  to  work  unless  the
program library  already contains  the  packages  REAL_OPERATIONS  and
TEXT_IO on  which QUADRATIC_EQUATION  depends. Otherwise  the function
SQRT supplied by the package REAL_OPERATIONS would not be visible; nor
would similarly  the procedures GET and PUT supplied by REAL_IO within
REAL_OPERATIONS and by TEXT_IO.
<p>
Realizing that  this program might be generally usable, the programmer
may decide  to encapsulate  it within  a package,  perhaps along  with
other similar procedures:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with REAL_OPERATIONS;  use REAL_OPERATIONS;
package EQUATION_SOLVER is
  procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION;
  procedure LINEAR_EQUATION;
  -- other procedures needing real operations
  -- in their declaration
end;

with TEXT_IO;
package body EQUATION_SOLVER is

  procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION is
    -- same text as before
  end;

  procedure LINEAR_EQUATION is
    -- reads a linear equation, solves it, prints results
  end;
    ...
end EQUATION_SOLVER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  the context  clause for  REAL_OPERATIONS is  needed for the
body as  well as  for the  declaration of the package EQUATION_SOLVER,
but need  not be  repeated for  the body since the context clause of a
package declaration  applies also  to the  corresponding package body.
However, TEXT_IO  is needed  only by  the body,  so it would introduce
unwanted dependences  to mention  it in  the  context  clause  of  the
package declaration.
<p>
A program that uses this package is shown below:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with EQUATION_SOLVER;  use EQUATION_SOLVER;
procedure EXERCISE is        -- solves 10 quadratic equations
begin
  for I in 1 .. 10 loop
    QUADRATIC_EQUATION;
  end loop;
end EXERCISE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The program  EXERCISE need only mention the package EQUATION_SOLVER in
its context  clause. It need not (and should not) mention the packages
REAL_OPERATIONS and  TEXT_IO, which are actually needed by the package
body of  EQUATION_SOLVER, since EXERCISE does not contain direct calls
to subprograms defined in either REAL_OPERATIONS or TEXT_IO.
<p>
Note also that a library unit may be a generic unit. Instances of such
generic compilation units can be obtained as usual:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with DIRECT_IO;
procedure TREAT_ITEMS is
  type ITEM is ...
  package ITEM_IO is new DIRECT_IO (ELEMENT_TYPE =&gt;  ITEM);
  ...          -- use of the input-output procedures for objects of
type ITEM
end TREAT_ITEMS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here a  use clause for the generic package DIRECT_IO would be illegal;
one for the instance ITEM_IO may appear after the instantiation.
<p>
Finally, a  library unit  may be  an  instance  of  another  (generic)
library unit:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with DIRECT_IO;
package FLOAT_IO is new DIRECT_IO(FLOAT);
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.2">10.2.2 Hierarchical Program Development</a></H3>

The other  style of program development is called hierarchical or top-
down, as  used in  programming by  stepwise refinement <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Wi 71, Wo 72]</a>.
The top  level provides  a formulation  of the  program  in  terms  of
operations that  are to be supplied by the next lower level. Each such
operation is  then further  defined in  terms of operations of another
lower  level,  and  so  on.  In  support  of  this  style  of  program
development, Ada  offers the  possibility of  having compilation units
that are subunits of other compilation units.
<p>
We illustrate subunits by means of a variant of the example of <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-10-02.html#10.2.1">section
10.2.1 of  the Reference  Manual</a>. Assume  that we  are developing  the
procedure TOP  in a  top-down fashion.  The top level of definition is
given by the following compilation unit:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure TOP is

  type REAL is digits 10;
  NEXT :  REAL;

  procedure TRANSFORM(U :  in out REAL);

  package TABLE is
    procedure    INSERT(X :  in REAL);
    function     FIRST return REAL;
    procedure    DISPLAY;
  end;

  package body TABLE is separate;                      -- stub of TABLE

  procedure TRANSFORM(U :  in out REAL) is separate;   -- stub of TRANSFORM

begin      -- TOP
  ...
  TRANSFORM(NEXT);
  ...
  TABLE.INSERT(NEXT);
  TABLE.DISPLAY;
  ...
end TOP;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The specifications of the procedure TRANSFORM and of the package TABLE
are given  as usual.  Hence the  statements of TOP can be expressed in
terms of  these units  and can  invoke the procedure TRANSFORM and the
subprograms INSERT, FIRST, and DISPLAY that are defined by the package
TABLE. However, the proper body of TRANSFORM (and TABLE) is separately
compiled and  is not,  therefore, provided as part of the text of TOP.
In each  case a body stub has been given at the place where the proper
body would  appear if it were not separately compiled. The role of the
stub is  to inform  the compiler  that the  proper body is to be found
elsewhere -  as a  separately compiled  subunit. Without the stub, the
compiler would  issue an  error message;  with the stub, it is told to
expect that  sooner or  later a  subunit such as the following will be
submitted:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
separate (TOP) procedure TRANSFORM(U :  in out REAL) is
  use TABLE;
begin
  ...
  U :=  FIRST;
  ...
end TRANSFORM;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Although separately  compiled, TRANSFORM  still has  visibility of the
identifiers that are declared within TOP. For example it sees the type
REAL and  the package  name TABLE. This dependence is reflected by the
presence of
<p>
<PRE>    separate(TOP)</PRE>
<p>
at the  start of  the subunit.  This indicates  that TOP is the parent
unit of  the procedure  TRANSFORM; the parent unit is the program unit
that  contains   the  stub   that  announces   the  subunit.   Similar
considerations apply  to the  separately compiled  body of the package
TABLE:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
separate (TOP) package body TABLE is
  -- some local declarations of TABLE followed by

  procedure INSERT(X :  REAL) is
  begin
    -- sequence of statements of INSERT
  end;

  function FIRST return REAL is
  begin
    -- sequence of statements of FIRST
  end;

  procedure DISPLAY is separate;      -- stub of DISPLAY
end TABLE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In this  case the  package body  contains the  proper  bodies  of  the
procedure INSERT  and the function FIRST, but another stub in the case
of the procedure DISPLAY, which is thus a subunit of TABLE:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with TEXT_IO;
separate (TOP.TABLE) procedure DISPLAY is
begin
  -- sequence of statements of DISPLAY
end DISPLAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  the name of the parent unit must be given in full, starting
with the  ancestor library  unit TOP,  in order  correctly to identify
TABLE. There  could be other subunits called TABLE in the same program
library (although not for the same ancestor TOP).
<p>
Note also  that it is possible to provide a with clause for a subunit,
as for any compilation unit. In this example, assuming that DISPLAY is
the only  procedure performing input-output, the dependence on TEXT_IO
is conveniently  localized to  that procedure  (instead of  creating a
more global dependence at the level of TOP or at that of TABLE).
<p>
Subunits can  be declared  at the  outermost level  of another unit or
subunit. This  creates the  possibility of  an  hierarchy  of  program
subunits depending  on a  given compilation unit. This hierarchy is no
different from  the nesting  hierarchy in  ordinary program  units. In
particular, the visibility rules are the same and a subunit can depend
on dynamic information. For example, consider
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
separate (TOP) procedure TRANSFORM(U :  in out REAL) is
  use TABLE;
  SQUARE :  REAL  :=  U &#42;&#42; 2;
  procedure UPDATE is separate;
begin
  ...
end TRANSFORM;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Access to  the local  variable SQUARE is still possible within UPDATE,
exactly as if the body of UPDATE were textually nested at the place of
the stub.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
separate (TOP.TRANSFORM) procedure UPDATE is
begin
  -- access to SQUARE is possible
end UPDATE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
It should  be clear  that these two methods of introducing compilation
units are  not mutually  exclusive and can be used in combination. For
example, a general purpose package may be split into subunits in order
to   facilitate   its   development,   compilation,   and   subsequent
recompilation.

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.3">10.2.3 Compilation Order</a></H3>

Compilation units  may be  compiled separately, but this does not mean
that compilations  can be submitted in an arbitrary order, since units
are not  independent. In  particular we  have seen  that  the  context
clause of one unit may mention the name of another unit, and that some
units are  subunits of  other units. These two forms of dependence and
the usual  dependence of  a body  on the  corresponding  specification
determine a partial ordering of compilations:
<ul>
<li>A compilation  unit must be compiled after all units that are named
   by its context clause.
<p>
<li>A secondary  unit that  is a subprogram body or a package body must
   be compiled  after the library unit that provides the corresponding
   subprogram specification or package specification.
<p>
<li>A secondary  unit that  is a  subunit must  be compiled  after  its
   parent unit.
</ul>

These rules  are rules of common sense and they must be enforced by an
Ada Compiler.  These order  relations are summarized below in the case
of the  procedures QUADRATIC_EQUATION  and TOP. The notation "A &lt;-- B"
is used to indicate that A must be compiled before B.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
Specification of REAL_OPERATIONS &lt;-- Body of REAL_OPERATIONS
Specification of REAL_OPERATIONS &lt;-- QUADRATIC_EQUATION

Specification of TEXT_IO &lt;-- Body of TEXT_IO
Specification of TEXT_IO &lt;-- QUADRATIC_EQUATION
Specification of TEXT_IO &lt;-- DISPLAY

TOP &lt;-- TABLE     &lt;-- DISPLAY
TOP &lt;-- TRANSFORM &lt;-- UPDATE
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
It should be clear that these relations only define a partial ordering
of compilations. For example:
<ul>
<li>The bodies  of the  packages REAL_OPERATIONS  and TEXT_IO  are  two
   secondary units  that can  be compiled in either order. Furthermore
   QUADRATIC_EQUATION can be compiled either before or after either of
   these secondary units.
<p>
<li>The subunit  TABLE can  be  compiled  before  or  after  TRANSFORM,
   indifferently. Similarly the relative order of compilation of TABLE
   with respect  to UPDATE,  of TRANSFORM with respect to DISPLAY, and
   of DISPLAY with respect to UPDATE, are all undefined.
</ul>

Of course,  in order  to execute the program, it is necessary that all
compilations be  completed: an  Ada compiler  or library  manager will
report an error if this is not the case.
<p>
Note that  although the  body of  TRANSFORM includes a use clause that
mentions TABLE,  this has  no influence on compilation order: the only
information that TRANSFORM may obtain about TABLE is that given by the
declaration of  TABLE, and  this declaration  is part  of the (common)
parent unit  TOP; hence  the use  clause will  not affect  the subunit
TABLE -  which is  a package  body. No  use clause  will  ever  affect
compilation order.

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.4">10.2.4 Recompilation Order</a></H3>

Similar considerations  apply in  the case  of  recompilation.  If  we
change the  definition of  some entity, then any compilation unit that
used the previous definition is now obsolete and must be recompiled.
<p>
In principle,  this rule  could be applied to individual declarations.
However, for  the sake  of compiler simplicity, Ada compilers are only
required to consider that the quantum of change is the (re)compilation
of  a   whole  compilation   unit.  Thus   any  change  to  a  package
specification is  assumed to affect any compilation unit that mentions
this package  in a  with clause. Similarly any change to a parent unit
is  assumed   to  affect  all  its  subunits.  With  this  simplifying
assumption, the  rules defining  the need  for  recompilations  follow
directly from the above-defined order relations.
<ul>
<li>After recompilation  of the declaration of REAL_OPERATIONS the body
   of REAL_OPERATIONS  and the  procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION  must  be
   recompiled.
<p>
<li>After recompilation  of the declaration of TEXT_IO (if that is even
   possible) the  body of  TEXT_IO, the  procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION,
   and the subunit DISPLAY must be recompiled.
<p>
<li>The subunit  DISPLAY must  be recompiled after the recompilation of
   its parent  TABLE; similarly the subunit UPDATE after recompilation
   of TRANSFORM;  and all  of TABLE,  DISPLAY, TRANSFORM,  and  UPDATE
   after recompilation of TOP.
</ul>

In principle, a compiler that included a librarian facility for source
texts could  compare the  old text  of a compilation unit with the new
text and  keep track  of changes on an individual basis. Thus it could
detect  that   although  a   given  package   specification  had  been
recompiled, the modification did not actually affect other compilation
units that used this package but did not use the modified part. Such a
compiler could  then optimize  by cutting  short the  process and  not
recompiling those  other units  - simply  marking them  as  no  longer
obsolete, realizing  that the  recompiled dependent unit would deliver
the same results as the previous one.
<p>
The above  optimization is not imposed on all Ada compilers: given the
ability separately  to compile  a package  or subprogram specification
and the  corresponding body,  the simple strategy (using a compilation
unit  as   quantum)  should   not  in   practice  require   many  more
recompilations than strictly necessary.
<p>
Note, in  this respect, that the language design has carefully avoided
unnecessary textual  dependence. For  example, the fact that a context
clause is  associated with  a subunit  rather than with a body stub is
quite important. Consider the alternative:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure EXAMPLE is
  ...
  -- The following is not in Ada:

  with TEXT_IO;               -- Illegal in this position
  procedure P(X :  INTEGER) is separate;

  with REAL_OPERATIONS;       -- Illegal in this position
  procedure Q(Y :  REAL) is separate;
  ...
end EXAMPLE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Assume that  in some  later revision of this program, TEXT_IO needs to
be used  also within  the body  of Q.  Then if  context  clauses  were
provided with  the stubs as shown, it would be necessary to modify the
stub of  Q and  hence to  recompile the  text of  the EXAMPLE. However
since the  stub of  P is  also provided  there -  this is  the textual
dependence -  a compiler  using the  simple strategy  would not notice
that the  stub of  P was  unmodified, and would have to recompile P as
well.
<p>
While we  recognize that  future compilers  might adopt more ambitious
schemes, the  Ada design  has carefully avoided any feature that would
be incompatible with the simple strategy. Given this careful avoidance
of unnecessary textual dependences the number of recompilations can be
kept quite close to the actual minimum.

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.5">10.2.5 Execution of a Main Program</a></H3>

Prior  to   the  execution   of  a   main  program   such  as  TOP  or
QUADRATIC_EQUATION,  any   library  unit  that  is  used  directly  or
indirectly by  this main  program must be elaborated. For example, the
package declarations  of TEXT_IO  and REAL_OPERATIONS  are  elaborated
before control is passed to QUADRATIC_EQUATION; furthermore, any other
library unit  that is  used by  these packages or by their bodies must
also be elaborated before control is passed to QUADRATIC_EQUATION.
<p>
The order  of elaboration  of these library units is not fully defined
but must  be consistent  with the  partial  ordering  defined  by  the
dependences.

<H3><BR><a name="10.2.6">10.2.6 The Pragma ELABORATE</a></H3>

In most  cases, the  Ada library  manager can  choose any  elaboration
order consistent  with the unit dependences, and the resulting program
will always  have the  same effect.  However, in  some  cases  further
control over elaboration order is required. Here is an example.
<p>
Suppose we  have a  package specification  PRINT that uses the package
SIMPLE_IO of <a href="ratl-09.html#9">Chapter 9</a>. The specification might look like this:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with SIMPLE_IO; use SIMPLE_IO;
package PRINT is
  DATA, RESULTS :  FILE_NAME;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
and the package body will of course say something like:
<PRE>    CREATE(RESULTS, "Results");</PRE>
<p>
This creates the partial orderings
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
Specification of SIMPLE_IO &lt;-- Body of SIMPLE_IO
Specification of SIMPLE_IO &lt;-- Specification of PRINT
Specification of PRINT     &lt;-- Body of PRINT
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  (so far)  there is no ordering relation between the body of
SIMPLE_IO and the specification or body of PRINT. However, PRINT calls
SIMPLE_IO.CREATE. CREATE presumably changes the local object DIRECTORY
in the  body of SIMPLE_IO. And DIRECTORY is initialized - set into its
first consistent  state - by the elaboration of the body of SIMPLE_IO.
For this  sequence of  events to  work, we  must elaborate the body of
SIMPLE_IO before any call of SIMPLE_IO.CREATE.
<p>
To  express  this  kind  of  dependence,  Ada  introduces  the  pragma
ELABORATE. It  may be used immediately following a context clause, and
may take  as arguments  any of  the library  units referred  to by the
context clause.  Its meaning  is that  the body of the referenced unit
must be elaborated before the elaboration of the referencing unit.
<p>
In the case above, the user would write
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with SIMPLE_IO;
pragma ELABORATE(SIMPLE_IO);
use SIMPLE_IO;
package PRINT is
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This creates a new partial ordering
<p>
<PRE>    Body of SIMPLE_IO &lt;-- Specification of PRINT</PRE>
<p>
which ensures  that any  use of the services of SIMPLE_IO occurs after
the state  variables have  been initialized. Of course, the program is
illegal if no consistent order is possible.
