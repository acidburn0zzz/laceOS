<H2>CHAPTER 4: Types</H2>

<H3><a name="4.6">4.6 Record Types</a></H3>

The basic  form of  record type is similar to that provided in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>:
the component  declarations are  enclosed by the reserved words record
and end record, as in the following example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DATE is
  record
    MONTH  :  MONTH_NAME;           -- a suitable enumeration type
    DAY    :  INTEGER range 1 .. 31;
    YEAR   :  INTEGER range 1 .. 3000;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here the  set of  values consists  of all ordered triples containing a
month, a  day, and  a year  in this  order and  having  the  specified
component names  MONTH, DAY,  YEAR. The  set  of  operations  includes
assignment, test  for equality,  component  selection,  and  aggregate
formation. For example, having declared
<p>
<PRE>    TODAY :  DATE;</PRE>
<p>
we can select the corresponding year by a selected component
<p>
<PRE>    TODAY.YEAR</PRE>
<p>
as in the following assignment
<p>
<PRE>    TODAY.YEAR :=  TODAY.YEAR + 1;</PRE>
<p>
Selection of  the component YEAR can actually be viewed as achieved by
a basic  operation ".YEAR"  which can  be applied in postfix manner to
the name  of any  object of  type DATE.  These  basic  operations  are
implicitly declared  by the  record type  declaration itself, although
Ada does not allow the explicit declaration of postfix operations such
as ".YEAR".
<p>
Aggregates have  already been  discussed in <a href="ratl-03-05.html#3.5">section 3.5</a>: in particular
we  have  seen  that  Ada  provides  both  positional  aggregates  and
aggregates in named notation:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
(DEC, 12, 1983)                                         -- positional
(DAY =&gt;  12,  MONTH =&gt;  DEC,  YEAR =&gt;  1983)   -- named
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>
<center><TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=6>
   <TR>
      <TD>
<b><font size=+1>In this section...</font>
<p>
<a href="#4.6.1">4.6.1  Equivalence</a><BR>
<a href="#4.6.2">4.6.2  Default Initialization of Record Components</a><BR>
<b>
     </TD>
   </TR>
</TABLE></center>
<p>

<H3><BR><a name="4.6.1">4.6.1 Equivalence</a></H3>

Name equivalence  is used  for record  types, as  for other  types. To
emphasize the  arguments against  structural equivalence, consider the
following record type declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PAIR is
  record
    LEFT  :  INTEGER;
    RIGHT :  INTEGER;
  end record;

type RATIONAL is
  record
    NUMERATOR     :  INTEGER;
    DENOMINATOR   :  INTEGER range 1 .. INTEGER'LAST;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Several alternative  forms of  structural  equivalence  rules  can  be
considered, involving  increasing amounts  of checking,  especially if
the record types have a large number of components:
<ol type=a>
<li>Two record types are equivalent if the texts of their
   type  definitions   (what   appears   after   is)   are   identical
   (disregarding textual layout such as spaces, new lines, and so on).
<p>
<li>Two record types are equivalent if they have the same
   number of components, and at each component position, corresponding
   components have  the same  name and are declared with the same type
   name.
<p>
<li>Same as (b) but the names of corresponding components
   need not  agree, only  the type  names. This is a more mathematical
   point of view, where one considers a record as a cartesian product.
<p>
<li>Same as  (b) but  the  order  of  components  is  not
   significant.
<p>
<li>Same as  (c) but  the  constraints  on  corresponding
   components may differ.
<p>
<li>Same as (e) but the subtypes must be the same.
<p>
<li>Same  as   (e)  but   the  component  types  must  be
   equivalent, while their names need not be identical.
<p>
<li>Same as (g) but a type name is also equivalent to the
   text of  the corresponding  type definition  (which could  even  be
   anonymous).
</ol>

The types  PAIR and RATIONAL given above would be equivalent under all
the rules  if their  component names were accidentally the same and if
the  constraint   on  DENOMINATOR  were  not  expressed  in  the  type
declaration.  More   specifically,  under  rule  (b),  PAIR  would  be
equivalent to
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type ANOTHER_PAIR is
  record
    LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Rule (c)  makes sense  for a  language for which all aggregates are in
positional notation.  It complicates  the checking  by  the  compiler,
since all permutations must be considered. Conversely, the rule (d) is
sensible for  a totally  non-positional language where components must
always be  named  in  record  aggregates.  Rule  (e)  complicates  the
implementation of  constraints and subtypes for components, since they
must be  checked for  each component  on record  or array assignments.
Rule (f)  cannot be  checked statically. Rule (g) requires a recursive
matching algorithm. In addition, rule (h) requires type expansion, and
even an algorithm of cycle reduction in the case of mutually recursive
access types.
<p>
All these complexities for the implementation - and above all, for the
reader -  are avoided  in Ada  by adopting  the simple rule that every
declaration declares a distinct type.

<H3><BR><a name="4.6.2">4.6.2 Default Initialization of Record Components</a>
</H3><p>

Default initialization can be specified for some or for all components
of a record. Consider for example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type FRACTION is
  record
    DIVIDEND :  INTEGER    :=  0;
    DIVISOR  :  POSITIVE   :=  1;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The indicated  initializations will be performed by the elaboration of
the declaration  of an  object of  type FRACTION,  in the  absence  of
explicit initialization. Thus after the elaboration of
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
F  :  FRACTION;
G  :  FRACTION  :=  (2, 3);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
the value  of F  is well-defined  and is  equal to (0, 1), whereas the
value  of  G  is  equal  to  (2,  3)  as  specified  by  the  explicit
initialization.
<p>
Note that initial values need not be static, as is illustrated here:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type BUFFER(LENGTH :  POSITIVE) is
  record
    POS      :  NATURAL  :=  0;
    VALUE :  STRING(1 .. LENGTH)  :=  (1 .. LENGTH =&gt;  ' ');
  end record;

type TRIPLE is
  record
    A, B, C :  PERSON_NAME  :=  new PERSON;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The  following   example  shows   that  default   initializations  (in
combination with  access types)  can even  be used  to construct quite
elaborate dynamic structures:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type NODE(LEVEL :  POSITIVE  :=  1);
type LINK is access NODE;
function BRANCH(N :  POSITIVE) return LINK;

type NODE(LEVEL :  POSITIVE  :=  1) is
  record
    VALUE :  ITEM  :=  NULL_ITEM;
    LEFT, RIGHT :  LINK  :=  BRANCH(LEVEL);
  end record;

function BRANCH(N :  POSITIVE) return LINK is
begin
  if N = 1 then
    return null;
  else
    return new NODE(N - 1);
  end if;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Thus whereas the declaration
<p>
<PRE>    TERMINAL :  NODE(1);</PRE>
<p>
will create a single node, a declaration such as
<p>
<PRE>    TREE :  NODE(5);</PRE>
<p>
will lead  to the  dynamic creation  of a  complete binary tree with 5
levels (thus  including 1 node of level 5, 2 nodes of level 4, 4 nodes
of level 3, 8 nodes of level 2, and 16 nodes of level 1).
<p>
The previous  example is mainly intended to show the power that can be
achieved by  default initializations.  Clearly more power also creates
more danger and an incorrect program could certainly enter an infinite
recursion during the elaboration of declarations.
<p>
The main motivation for allowing default initialization is however one
of program reliability. In many applications, it is found desirable to
have a  consistent initial state for all objects: the services offered
by  the   program  may   critically  depend   on  objects  being  well
initialized. To  achieve this,  we could  of course  define an initial
value to  be used  for all  declarations, or provide the users with an
initialization procedure to be applied before any other use is made of
objects. The  weakness of  these approaches  lies in the fact that our
program would  remain vulnerable  to users  that do  not  follow  this
initialization discipline  (whether unintentionally  or not). The only
safe solution  is therefore  to have  a default initialization that is
invoked without any reliance on the user.
