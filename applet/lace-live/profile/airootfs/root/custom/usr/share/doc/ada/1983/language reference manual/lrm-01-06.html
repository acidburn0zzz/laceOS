<P>
The   language   definition   classifies   errors  into  several  different
categories: 
<ol>
<li>Errors that  must  be  detected  at  compilation  time  by  every  Ada
compiler. 
<br><br>
These  errors  correspond  to  any  violation  of a rule given in this
reference manual, other than the violations that correspond to (b)  or
(c)  below.   In particular, violation of any rule that uses the terms
must, allowed, legal,  or  illegal  belongs  to  this  category.   Any
program  that  contains  such an error is not a legal Ada program;  on  
the other hand, the fact that a program is legal does  not  mean,  per
se, that the program is free from other forms of error. 
<br><br>
<li>Errors that must be detected at run time by the execution  of  an  Ada
program. 
<br><br>
The  corresponding  error  situations are associated with the names of
the predefined exceptions.  Every Ada compiler is required to generate
code  that  raises  the  corresponding  exception  if  such  an  error
situation arises during program execution.  If an exception is certain
to  be  raised  in  every  execution  of a program, then compilers are
allowed (although not required) to report  this  fact  at  compilation
time.                                            
<br><br>
<li>Erroneous execution. 
<br><br>
The language rules specify certain rules to be obeyed by Ada programs,
although  there is no requirement on Ada compilers to provide either a
compilation-time or a run-time detection  of  the  violation  of  such
rules.   The  errors  of this category are indicated by the use of the
word  erroneous  to  qualify  the  execution  of   the   corresponding
constructs.  The effect of erroneous execution is unpredictable. 
<br><br>
<li>Incorrect order dependences. 
<br><br>
Whenever  the  reference  manual  specifies  that different parts of a
given construct are to be executed in some order that is  not  defined
by  the  language,  this  means  that the implementation is allowed to
execute these parts in any  given  order,  following  the  rules  that
result  from  that given order, but not in parallel.  Furthermore, the
construct is incorrect if execution of  these  parts  in  a  different
order  would  have  a different effect.  Compilers are not required to
provide either compilation-time or  run-time  detection  of  incorrect
order dependences.  The foregoing is expressed in terms of the process
that  is  called  execution;  it applies equally to the processes that
are called evaluation and elaboration. 
</ol>
If a compiler is able to recognize at compilation time that a construct  is
erroneous  or  contains an incorrect order dependence, then the compiler is
allowed to generate, in place of  the  code  otherwise  generated  for  the
construct,   code  that  raises  the  predefined  exception  PROGRAM_ERROR.
Similarly, compilers are allowed to generate code that checks at  run  time
for  erroneous  constructs,  for  incorrect order dependences, or for both.
The predefined exception PROGRAM_ERROR is raised if such a check fails.
