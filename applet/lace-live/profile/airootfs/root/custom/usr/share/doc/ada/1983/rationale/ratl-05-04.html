<H2>CHAPTER 5: Numeric Types</H2>

<H3><a name="5.4">5.4 Implementation Considerations</a></H3>

Fixed point  types can be represented on most machines with one or two
machine words. Implementations should not support fixed point types in
excess of  this length if credible performance is required (and cannot
be provided).  Note that the predefined type DURATION requires 23 bits
of accuracy (plus one sign bit), because the reference manual requires
that intervals  of at  least twenty  milliseconds be  accommodated, as
well as an interval of up to a day. Such an implementation would be as
efficient in time and space as conventional assembler coding (assuming
a good  register allocation algorithm). As with subranges of integers,
tight packing  is possible, and this could result in a major advantage
over floating point.
<p>
Good performance  depends largely upon the proper specification of the
range and  delta. For machines with limited arithmetic shifts, a value
in a  range  that  excludes  negative  values  could  have  its  scale
converted by  the use  of logical  shifts. All  type conversions  with
fixed types  could be  accomplished with  simple arithmetic shifts and
masking. All the operations are likewise straightforward.
<p>
With real  types there  is a problem about the end points of the range
with a  range constraint.  Ordinarily, such values would be in the set
of values  permitted. However,  a fixed  point range  0.0 ..  1.0 on a
two's complement  machine would  not usually  want to  include 1.0. To
avoid giving  ranges as  0.0 ..  0.999999999, it  seems  best  not  to
require that nonzero end values be within the specified range. See the
wording in <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-03-05.html#3.5.9">RM 3.5.9</a>(6) for details.
<p>
A lazy  implementation of  numeric types  which could  be  used  by  a
diagnostic compiler  is as  follows. Every  value is  stored  in  long
floating point format together with a flag indicating if it is integer
or real.  The long  format must  be sufficiently long to encompass the
longest integer, fixed point and floating point types supported by the
implementation. Operations  can now  be applied  to these  values, the
flag being  used to  ensure that integer results are correctly rounded
to integers  (if the  floating point  hardware does  not give  integer
results from  integer values).  This implementation  method is clearly
inefficient, especially for fixed point types, which are often used as
a method of avoiding expensive floating point. However, it illustrates
the concept of the abstract value and the fact that the operators have
the same meaning for each type.
<p>
Although  it  is  theoretically  feasible,  it  is  not  practical  to
implement floating  point types  as fixed  point quantities.  This  is
because of  the potentially  large dynamic  range  of  floating  point
values -  a floating  point mantissa length B would need small = 2&#42;&#42;(-
5&#42;B) and hence fixed point mantissa length 9&#42;B.
<p>
With the  real types,  the  language  does  not  specify  rounding  or
truncation, since either choice could be excessively expensive on some
machines. The  user can control its effect by increasing the digits or
decreasing the  delta in  the type declaration, but should note that a
small decrease  in the  delta could  require going  from 1  word to  2
words, with  consequent performance  degradation. With  multiplication
and division,  rounding may  be required  in  order  to  preserve  the
relational inequalities.  Exact  conversion  can  only  occur  between
integer types  (although many  other conversions  may not  require any
rounding). No  conversions are significantly more troublesome than are
integer to real and real to integer in (say) Algol 60.
<p>
Consider a  function ROOT  for taking  the square root of an argument,
where the argument and the result are of type FRACTION:
<PRE>    type FRACTION is delta D range 0.0 .. 1.0;</PRE>
<p>
By declaring  the fixed  point quantities  X and Y to have a type with
larger delta:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type SIXTEEN is delta 16.0&#42;D range 0.0 .. 16.0;
X, Y :  SIXTEEN;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
one can then take the square root of X by
<PRE>    Y :=  SIXTEEN(4 &#42; ROOT(FRACTION (X/16)));</PRE>
<p>
and here  the division  by 16  is a  shift  that  corresponds  to  the
converse of  the FRACTION  type conversion  and hence produces no code
(assuming reasonable peephole optimization). (Note that the literals 4
and 16 are integers; real literals would not be allowed here.)
<p>
The body of ROOT (for argument range 0.5 to 1) could be:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function ROOT(X :  FRACTION) return FRACTION is
  HALF :  constant FRACTION :=  0.5;
  APPROX :  FRACTION  :=  0.7;           -- a starting value
begin
  while abs(APPROX - FRACTION(X/APPROX)) &gt; FRACTION'DELTA loop
    APPROX :=  FRACTION(HALF &#42; (APPROX + FRACTION(X/APPROX)));
  end loop;
  return APPROX;
end ROOT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The machine  dependence is  largely restricted  to the  declaration of
FRACTION, whose  range relative to the accuracy would reflect the word
length of  the machine.  Note that  since the declared range is 0.0 ..
1.0 the algorithm may give values equal to 1.0 for arguments near 1.0.
This would cause overflow on a two's complement machine. The check for
negative arguments is implicit in the type definition.
<p>
In evaluating an expression at compilation time, the identification of
the operators  must be  performed.  Then  expressions  involving  only
literals,  constants,   other  evaluated  expressions  and  predefined
operators can  be evaluated.  The accuracy of real arithmetic may here
be different from that of the target machine, although both are within
that specified in the type declarations.
<p>
The efficient  implementation of some mathematical algorithms requires
access to the component parts of a floating point value. For instance,
a square  root routine  typically starts  by  estimating  a  value  by
dividing the exponent by 2. We therefore need to be able to access and
update the exponent. This can elegantly be done in Ada by the use of a
record type  and associated  record representation clause defining the
internal structure  of  the  floating  point  value,  and  then  using
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION to  convert between  the floating  point type and
the record  type. Such operations are best performed by subprograms in
the mathematical  library; in  this way  the implementation  dependent
operations can be encapsulated so that they are hidden from the normal
user.
<p>
The above example illustrates the essential dilemma between efficiency
and  portability   that  intrudes  into  certain  sensitive  areas  of
numerical computation;  there are  occasions where  the demands  for a
very efficient implementation outweigh those for complete portability.
The facilities  in Ada  enable the  non-portable parts  to be  readily
identified and  encapsulated so  that a  proper  balance  between  the
conflicting aims can be obtained.
