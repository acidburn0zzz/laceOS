<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.5">15.5 Enumeration Types with Noncontiguous Representations</a></H3>

The specified  internal codes  of an  enumeration type  need not  have
contiguous values.  This degree of generality is required if character
types are to be represented by enumeration types, since many character
sets have noncontiguous internal values.
<p>
We next  discuss the  implications of noncontiguous representations on
assignment and comparison, indexing and case selection, and finally on
iteration.

<H3><BR><a name="15.5.1">15.5.1 Assignment and Comparison with Noncontiguous Enumeration Types</a></H3>

An assignment  only results  in moving  a value  from one  location to
another, and  thus  is  not  influenced  by  the  noncontiguity  of  a
representation. Similarly, noncontiguity has no impact on comparison.

<H3><BR><a name="15.5.2">15.5.2 Indexing and Case Statements with Noncontiguous Enumeration
Types</a></H3>

The simplest way to treat an array indexed by an enumeration type that
has a  noncontiguous representation  is to  implement it  as a  normal
array, but  leaving holes  (that is,  unused positions) in the storage
used. No  conversion is  then needed between the internal code and the
actual index  to storage, since they have the same value. In a similar
way, the  internal jump  table used  for a  case statement  could have
holes.
<p>
Note that  no problem arises when such arrays are passed as parameters
to subprograms  since the index type is part of the array type and the
same mapping will be used inside and outside the subprogram.
<p>
The user  should be  aware of the hidden storage costs involved: these
costs are  certainly preferable  to prohibiting  the use of types with
noncontiguous representations  for indexing and in case statements. If
we consider  character sets,  for instance,  the proportion  of  holes
remains at an acceptable level.

<H3><BR><a name="15.5.3">15.5.3 Iteration Over Noncontiguous Enumeration Types</a></H3>

We are  faced with  a more severe problem when a loop parameter ranges
over  the   values  of   a  noncontiguous   enumeration  type:  simply
incrementing the  value of  the loop  parameter by  a constant at each
iteration will  not work!  To keep  the same underlying mechanism, the
compiler may use a characteristic vector, that provides information on
holes. For  every  such  loop,  the  compiler  will  include  code  to
interrogate the characteristic vector.
<p>
This mechanism  is illustrated  by the following example. Consider the
type MIX_CODE,  for which  a  noncontiguous  representation  has  been
specified.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MIX_CODE is (ADD, SUB, MUL, LDA, STA, STZ);
for MIX_CODE use
  (ADD =&gt;  1, SUB =&gt;  2, MUL = &gt; 3, LDA =&gt;  8, STA =&gt;  24, STZ =&gt; 33);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A loop  statement that  iterates over  the values of the MIX_CODE type
can be written as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
for N in MIX_CODE loop
  DISPLAY(N);
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The compiler  could produce  object code  equivalent to  the following
text (apart from typing rules):
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
PRESENT :  constant array (1 .. 33) of BOOLEAN :=
            (1 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 24 | 33 =&gt;  TRUE,  others =&gt;  FALSE);

for J in PRESENT'RANGE loop
  if PRESENT(J) then
    DISPLAY(J);
  end if;
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
As illustrated above, the compilation involves a characteristic vector
(PRESENT) which  is used  to generate the integer values corresponding
to the enumeration type MIX_CODE. Thus we see that iterating over such
types is possible, but involves extra cost.
<p>
Another technique  is to  use a  representation vector  that maps  the
ordinals into the enumeration values:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
REPRESENTATION  :     constant   array  (0  ..  5)  of  INTEGER  := (1,2,3,8,24,33);
for J in REPRESENTATION'RANGE loop
  DISPLAY(REPRESENTATION(J));
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Similar techniques are used to implement 'SUCC, 'PRED, 'POS and 'VAL.

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.4">15.5.4 Character Types</a></H3>

Character types  are a  typical example  of enumeration types with not
necessarily contiguous  representations. The predefined character type
CHARACTER that  denotes the full ASCII character set of 128 characters
is contiguous,  but the  same  is  not  true  for  other  widely  used
character sets  such as  EBCDIC. Such character sets will generally be
defined in library modules, which will include both the character type
declaration and the associated representation specification. It may be
convenient to provide such a definition in two steps. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type CHAR is (enumeration of all EBCDIC characters);

type EBCDIC is new CHAR; -- same characters as CHAR

for EBCDIC use (codes corresponding to EBCDIC characters);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A user  to whom  the internal  code is relevant (perhaps because he is
performing input-output)  will declare  objects of  type  EBCDIC.  For
other uses,  especially if  such characters are to be used as indices,
in case statements and in iterations, the user might prefer to use the
type CHAR.  Since no  representation specification  is given  for this
type, the  translator will  adopt a  default  representation  that  is
convenient for indexing and iteration. Explicit conversion between the
two types can be performed.
<p>
Note however  that CHAR  and EBCDIC will have their values in the same
order, so  the user  cannot be relieved of all the problems associated
with this wretched data type.
