<H3><a name="7.6">7.6     Representation Clauses and Implementation-Dependent Features</a></H3>
Ada provides many implementation-dependent features that permit greater 
control over and interaction with the underlying hardware architecture than is 
normally provided by a high-order language. These mechanisms are intended to 
assist in systems programming and real-time programming to obtain greater 
efficiency (e.g., specific size layout of variables through representation 
clauses) and direct hardware interaction (e.g., interrupt entries) without 
having to resort to assembly level programming.<P>
Given the objectives for these features, it is not surprising that you must 
usually pay a significant price in portability to use them. In general, where 
portability is the main objective, do not use these features. When you must 
use these features, encapsulate them in packages well-commented as interfacing 
to the particular target environment. This section identifies the various 
features and their recommended use with respect to portability.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li> Use algorithms that do not depend on the representation of the data 
and therefore do not need representation clauses. 
<li>Use representation clauses when accessing interface data or when a  
specific representation is needed to implement a design. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
In many cases, it is easy to use representation clauses to implement an 
algorithm, even when it is not necessary.  There is also a tendency to 
document the original programmer's assumptions about the representation for 
future reference.  But there is no guarantee that another implementation will 
support the representation chosen.  Unnecessary representation clauses also 
confuse porting or maintenance efforts which must assume that the programmer 
depends on the documented representation.<P>
Interfaces to non-Ada systems and external devices are the most common  
situations where a representation clause is needed.  Uses of pragma <CODE>Interface</CODE> 
and address clauses should be evaluated during design and porting to determine  
whether a representation clause is needed.

<H4>note</H4>
During a porting effort, all representation clauses can be evaluated as either  
design artifacts or specifications for accessing interface data that might  
change with a new implementation.<P>

<UL>
<li> Avoid using package System constants except in attempting to

</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Since the values in this package are implementation-provided, unexpected 
effects can result from their use.

Do use package System constants to parameterize other implementation-dependent 
features (see Pappas [1985] section 13.7.1).<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid machine code inserts. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-C.html">Appendix C (of Department of Defense 1983)</a>
suggests that the package  
implementing machine code inserts is optional.  Additionally, it is not  
standardized so that machine code inserts are most likely not portable.  In  
fact, it is possible that two different vendors' syntax will differ for an  
identical target and differences in lower-level details such as register 
conventions will hinder portability.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
If machine code inserts must be used to meet another project requirement,  
recognize the portability decreasing effects.<P>
In the declarative region of the body of the routine where the machine code  
insert is being used, insert comments explaining what function the insert  
provides, and (especially) why the insert is necessary. Comment the necessity  
of using machine code inserts by delineating what went wrong with attempts to  
use other higher-level constructs.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid interfacing Ada with other languages.  
<li>Isolate all subprograms employing pragma <CODE>Interface</CODE> to  
implementation-dependent (interface) package bodies. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The problems with employing pragma <CODE>Interface</CODE> are complex. These problems 
include pragma syntax differences, conventions for linking/binding Ada to 
other languages, and mapping Ada variables to foreign language variables.  By 
hiding these dependencies within interface packages, the amount of code 
modification can be reduced.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
It is often necessary to interact with other languages, if only an assembly  
language to reach certain hardware features. In these cases, clearly comment  
the requirements and limitations of the interface and pragma <CODE>Interface</CODE> usage. <P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid pragmas and attributes added by the compiler implementor. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983)</a>
permits an  
implementor to add pragmas and attributes to exploit a particular hardware  
architecture or software environment. These are obviously even more  
implementation-specific and therefore less portable than an implementor's 
interpretations of the predefined pragmas and attributes.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Some implementation-dependent features are gaining wide acceptance in the Ada 
community to help alleviate inherent inefficiencies in some Ada features. A 
good example of this is the &quot;fast interrupt&quot; mechanism that provides a minimal 
interrupt latency time in exchange for a restrictive tasking environment. Ada 
community groups (e.g., <a href="http://info.acm.org/sigada/">SIGAda</a>'s
<a href="http://dec5200.gtri.gatech.edu/artewg/home.htm">ARTEWG</a>)
are attempting to standardize a 
common mechanism and syntax to provide this capability. By being aware of 
industry trends when specialized features must be used, you can take a more 
general approach that will help minimize the porting job.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="7.6.6">7.6.6   Unchecked Deallocation</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid dependence on <CODE>Unchecked_Deallocation</CODE>
(see <a href="sty-05-09.html#5.9.2">Guideline 5.9.2</a>). 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The unchecked storage deallocation mechanism is one method for overriding the 
default time at which allocated storage is reclaimed. The earliest default 
time is when an object is no longer accessible, e.g., when control leaves the 
scope where an access type was declared (the exact point after this time is 
implementation- dependent). Any unchecked deallocation of storage performed 
prior to this may result in an erroneous Ada program if an attempt is made to 
access the object.<P>
This guideline is stronger than <a href="sty-05-09.html#5.9.2">Guideline 5.9.2</a>
because of the extreme dependence on 
the implementation of <CODE>Unchecked_Deallocation</CODE>. Using it could cause 
considerable difficulty with portability.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Using unchecked deallocation of storage can be beneficial in local control of  
highly iterative or recursive algorithms where available storage may be  
exceeded.<P>

<UL>
<li>Avoid using <CODE>Unchecked_Conversion</CODE> (see <a href="sty-05-09.html#5.9.1">Guideline 5.9.1</a>). 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The unchecked type conversion mechanism is, in effect, a means of bypassing 
the strong typing facilities in Ada. An implementation is free to limit the 
types that may be matched and the results that occur when object sizes differ.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Unchecked type conversion is useful in implementation dependent parts of Ada  
programs (where lack of portability is isolated) where low-level programming 
and foreign language interfacing is the objective. <P>

<H3><BR><a name="7.6.8">7.6.8   Run Time Dependencies</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid the direct invocation of or implicit dependence upon an  
underlying host operating system or Ada run time support system. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Features of an implementation not specified in the
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983)</a>
will usually differ between  
implementations. Specific implementation-dependent features are not likely to 
be provided in other implementations. Even if a majority of vendors eventually  
provide similar features, they are unlikely to have identical formulations.  
Indeed, different vendors may use the same formulation for (semantically)  
entirely different features.<P>
Try to avoid these when coding. Consider the consequences of including system 
calls in a program on a host development system. If these calls are not 
flagged for removal and replacement, the program could go through development 
and testing only to be unusable when moved to a target environment which lacks 
the facilities provided by those system calls on the host.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
In real-time embedded systems, making calls to low-level support system 
facilities may often be unavoidable. Isolate the uses of these facilities may 
be too difficult. Comment them as you would machine code inserts (see 
<a href="#7.6.3">Guideline 7.6.3</a>); they are, in a sense, instructions for the virtual machine 
provided by the support system. When isolating the uses of these features, 
provide an interface for the rest of your program to use which can be ported 
through replacement of the interface's implementation.<P>
