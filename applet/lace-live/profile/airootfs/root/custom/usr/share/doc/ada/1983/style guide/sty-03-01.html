Spelling conventions in source code include rules for capitalization, use of  
underscores, and use of abbreviations. If these conventions are followed  
consistently, the resulting code is clearer and more readable.

When an identifier consists of more than one word, it is much easier to read 
if the words are separated by underscores. Indeed, there is precedent in 
English in which compound words are separated by a hyphen. In addition to 
promoting readability of the code, if underscores are used in names, a code 
formatter has more control over altering capitalization. See <a href="#3.1.3">Guideline 3.1.3</a>.

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>      Represent numbers in a consistent fashion.  
<li>Represent literals in a radix appropriate to the problem. 
<li>Use underscores to separate digits the same way commas or periods (or spaces for nondecimal bases) would be used in handwritten text. 
<li> When using scientific notation, make the E consistently either upper 
or lower case. 
<li> In an alternate base, represent the alphabetic characters in either 
all upper case or all lower case. 
</UL>
<BR>
<H4>instantiation</H4>
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>Decimal and octal numbers are grouped by threes beginning counting on  
either side of the radix point. 
<li>The E is always capitalized in scientific notation. 
<li>Use upper case for the alphabetic characters representing digits in  
bases above 10. 
<li>Hexadecimal numbers are grouped by fours beginning counting on either  
side of the radix point. 
</UL>

<H4>example </H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Maximum_Samples     is range          1 ..  1_000_000; 
type Legal_Hex_Address   is range   16#0000# ..   16#FFFF#; 
type Legal_Octal_Address is range 8#000_000# .. 8#777_777#;

Avogadro_Number : constant := 6.022_169E+23;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
To represent the number 1/3 as a constant, use
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>One_Third : constant := 1.0 / 3.0;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Avoid this use.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>One_Third_As_Decimal_Approximation : constant := 0.333_333_333_333_33;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
or
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>One_Third_Base_3 : constant := 3#0.1#; -- Yes, it really works!</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Consistent use of upper case or lower case aids scanning for numbers.  
Underscores serve to group portions of numbers into familiar patterns.  
Consistency with common use in everyday contexts is a large part of  
readability. 
<H4>note</H4>
If a rational fraction is represented in a base in which it has a terminating  
rather than repeating representation, as 3#0.1# does in the example above, it  
may have increased accuracy upon conversion to the machine base.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Visually distinguishing reserved words allows the reader to focus on program  
structure alone, if desired, and also aids scanning for particular identifiers.<P>
The instantiation chosen here is meant to be more readable for the experienced 
Ada programmer, who does not need reserved words to leap off the page. 
Beginners to any language often find that reserved words should be emphasized 
to help them find the control structures more easily.  Because of this, 
instructors in the classroom and books introducing the Ada language may want 
to consider an alternative instantiation.  It should be instructive to note 
that the Ada Language Reference Manual chose to bold all reserved words. 
Upper case for reserved words may also be suitable.

<H4>note</H4>
In Section 2.1, Nissen and Wallis (1984) states that &quot;The choice of case is 
highly debatable, and that chosen for the [Ada Language Reference Manual 
(Department of Defense 1983)] is not necessarily the best. The use of lower 
case for reserved words is often preferred, so that they do not stand out too 
much. However, lower case is generally easier to read than upper case; words 
can be distinguished by their overall shape, and can be found more quickly 
when scanning the text.&quot;

<H4>automation note</H4>
Ada names are not case sensitive. Therefore the names max_limit, MAX_LIMIT, 
and Max_Limit denote the same object or entity. A good code formatter should 
be able to automatically convert from one style to another as long as the 
words are delimited by underscores.<P>
As recommended in <a href="#3.1.4">Guideline 3.1.4</a>, abbreviations should be project wide.  An 
automated tool should allow a project to specify those abbreviations and 
format them accordingly.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="3.1.4">3.1.4   Abbreviations</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Do not use an abbreviation of a long word as an identifier where a  
shorter synonym exists. 
<li>Use a consistent abbreviation strategy. 
<li>Do not use ambiguous abbreviations. 
<li>An abbreviation must save many characters over the full word to be  
justified. 
<li>Use abbreviations that are well-accepted in the application domain. 
<li> Maintain a list of accepted abbreviations and use only abbreviations 
on that list. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Use <code>Time_Of_Receipt</code> rather than <CODE>Recd_Time</CODE> or <CODE>R_Time</CODE>.<P>
But in an application that commonly deals with message formats that meet  
military standards, <CODE>DOD_STD_MSG_FMT</CODE> is an acceptable abbreviation for:<BR>
<IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>Department_Of_Defense_Standard_Message_Format.</CODE>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Many abbreviations are ambiguous or unintelligible unless taken in context. As  
an example, Temp could indicate either temporary or temperature. For this  
reason, you should choose abbreviations carefully when you use them.  The  
rationale in <a href="sty-08-01.html#8.1.2">Guideline 8.1.2</a> provides a more thorough discussion of how context  
should influence the use of abbreviations.<P>
Since very long variable names can obscure the structure of the program, 
especially in deeply nested (indented) control structures, it is a good idea 
to try to keep identifiers short and meaningful. Use short unabbreviated names 
whenever possible. If there is no short word which will serve as an 
identifier, then a well known unambiguous abbreviation is the next best 
choice, especially if it comes from a list of standard abbreviations used 
throughout the project.<P>
An abbreviated format for a fully qualified name can be established via the  
renames clause. This capability is useful when a very long, fully qualified  
name would otherwise occur many times in a localized section of code (see  
<a href="sty-05-07.html#5.7.2">Guideline 5.7.2</a>).<P>
A list of accepted abbreviations for a project provides a standard context for  
using each abbreviation. <P>
