<h1>
1   Introduction
</h1>

<p>
This second part of the rationale is arranged to generally correspond to
the sections in the Ada 95 Reference Manual [RM95].  Thus the discussion
on exceptions which is covered in section 11 of [RM95] will be found in
Chapter 11 of this part.  The only exception to this is that the material
covered by sections 3 and 4 of [RM95] is subdivided differently.  Chapter
3 of this volume covers types and expressions in general whereas Chapter
4 concentrates on the object oriented features such as type extension and
class-wide types.
</p>
<p>
In a similar way the chapters of the third part correspond to the
annexes of [RM 95]; thus chapter C discusses the Systems Programming
Annex which is annex C of [RM 95].
</p>
<p>
   Each chapter of this second part starts with a brief summary of the
changes, there are then a number of sections addressing the various
topics, and finally there is a summary of the requirements addressed by
the chapter.
</p>
<p>
   This first chapter briefly covers the following general issues
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The description of Ada 95 uses more defined terms and there is less
     reliance on informal English.
<li>
    The syntax is expanded to bring more rules into the syntax and to
     increase clarity.
<li>
    The categorization of errors is revised and includes the
     introduction of the concept of bounded errors.
</ul>
<p>
However, before getting down to detail it is appropriate to start with a
few words about the approach adopted in the development of Ada 95.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=1>
1.1  Overall Approach
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Ada 95 is based on a building block approach.  Rather than providing a
number of new language features to directly solve each identified
application problem, the extra capability of Ada 95 is provided by a few
primitive language building blocks.  In combination, these building
blocks enable programmers to solve more application problems efficiently
and productively.
</p>
<p>
   Thus in the case of the object oriented area, much of the capability
is provided by the interweaving of the properties of type extension, the
child libraries and generic packages.  Great care has been taken to
ensure that the additional building blocks work together in a cohesive
and helpful manner.  Nevertheless implementation and understandability
considerations have sometimes caused some restrictions to be imposed.  An
example is that type extension of a formal generic parameter is not
permitted in a generic body (which would either break the contract model
or pose an intolerable pervasive implementation burden).
</p>
<p>
   An area of particular difficulty in tasking is the provision of mutual
exclusion (which is done in implementation terms by imposing semaphores
and locks at appropriate places).  Much of the difficulty with Ada 83
tasking lay in the composition of facilities to provide general paradigms
and especially the provision of guarded services.  Attempts to solve such
problems often resulted in race conditions precisely because the
facilities did not compose properly.  The only solution was paradigm
inversion whereby the high level tasking model was used to provide, in
essence, some low-level semaphore which could then be used in a medieval
fashion.  The introduction of protected types, barriers and the requeue
statement with two distinct levels of locking is designed to overcome
these difficulties.  Together, these building blocks may be used to
program natural and efficient solutions to problems involving a myriad of
real-time paradigms, including asynchronous communication, efficient
mutual exclusion, barrier synchronization, counting semaphores, and
broadcast of a signal.  To have provided separate features to solve each
of these problems would have resulted in a baroque language which would
have run into difficulties whenever a problem immediately outside the
original goals was encountered.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned in I.3 (in part one), there are four main areas where it
was felt that users needed additional functionality: Interfacing to other
systems, Programming by Extension (OOP), Programming in the Large
(Program Libraries), and Tasking.  Broadly speaking these needs are met
in Ada 95 by the following main features and are largely discussed in the
chapters indicated.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Interfacing:     by new forms of access types, pragmas and interface
     packages (Chapters 3 and B).
<li>
Programming by Extension:     by type extension and class-wide types
     (Chapter 4).
<li>
Programming in the Large:  by child library units (Chapter 10).
<li>
Tasking:  by protected objects (Chapter 9).
</ul>
<p>
Chapters 3, 4, 9 and 10 constitute the bulk of this part of the rationale
mainly because they contain a number of quite long examples.  The changes
described in the other chapters are more concerned with supporting detail
and less pervasive improvements.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=2>
1.2  The Reference Manual
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Ada 83 Reference Manual [RM83] is a remarkable document in that it is
one of the few definitions of a programming language that is regularly
read by normal programmers.  It achieves this by using natural English
wherever possible.
</p>
<p>
   A corollary of this success is, however, that it has not proved to be
quite so precise as desired by compiler writers.  Of course, there are
many more programmers than compiler writers and so the importance of the
programmer should not be underestimated.  However, it is vital that the
compiler writer be given as precise a description of the language as is
reasonably possible.  At the end of the day, provided that the compiler
is correct, then any misunderstanding of some subtle point on the part of
the programmer will generally give rise to an appropriate message from
the compiler.  Furthermore, textbooks and other material such as this
rationale are available to give pedagogic information to the programmer.
</p>
<p>
   The Ada 95 Reference Manual [RM95] thus continues the tradition of
readability and accessibility of the Ada 83 document wherever possible
but achieves greater precision by the careful introduction of more
specific terminology.  Different typography is also used to distinguish
normal English words from defined terms and syntax thereby increasing
clarity but retaining readability.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the definitive standard, the Annotated Ada Reference
Manual [AARM] is an annotated form containing much additional information
aimed largely at compiler writers, language lawyers and others with a
need for additional detailed information.  This contains such matters as
advice for implementers, rationale on fine detail, further awkward
examples and so on.  Both forms of the reference manual as well as this
rationale and other material are available in machine readable form on
the sw-eng.falls-church.va.us host in the public/ada9x/rm9x directory.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=3>
1.3  Syntax
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The syntax is expressed in the same notation as for Ada 83.  However, the
diligent reader will observe a considerable number of changes to the
description of the syntax.  Apart from those changes required by the new
parts of the language, the changes have been made in order to increase
clarity of the exposition.
</p>
<p>
   This increased clarity has been achieved at the cost of introducing
rather more new syntax rules than the increased size of the language
would suggest.  However, the extra clarity achieved brings major benefits
not only in understanding the syntax itself but also by some reduction in
the need for English text to explain rules which are now expressed by the
syntax.
</p>
<p>
   Examples of more notable changes (other than those corresponding to
completely new material) are as follows
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The rules for the characters used in the program text have been
     completely rewritten in a more structured manner.  The previous
     rules were not hierarchical and contained a curious imbalance
     between upper and lower case letters which is no longer appropriate.
<li>
    The category integer is now called numeral.  The term integer was
     somewhat inappropriate for what is simply a syntactic sequence of
     digits not specifically related to the integer types.
<li>
    Reserved words are no longer considered as identifiers.  A
     consequence is that the syntax now explicitly includes those
     attributes which double as reserved words, namely Delta, Digits,
     Range and Access (the last being a further such attribute in Ada
     95).
<li>
    Categories such as defining_identifier are introduced for those
     occurrences of identifiers which define an entity.  Usage
     occurrences use direct_name or selector_name according to the
     visibility rules.  The term simple_name is no longer used.  In Ada
     83 the term simple_name was used confusingly for just some usage
     occurrences.
<li>
    The category type_declaration now properly includes both task and
     protected types.  Surprisingly, task type declarations were excluded
     in Ada 83 probably because of a lack of reconsideration of the rules
     subsequent to the introduction of task types in around 1980.
<li>
    The category type_mark is replaced by subtype_mark because all names
     of types are now considered to actually denote the first named
     subtype.
<li>
    Scalar and composite constraints are now distinguished.
<li>
    A real change is that the category name is broadened to include
     function_call and type_conversion in accordance with changes to the
     concept of a name.  This causes a number of consequential changes to
     other definitions such as primary and prefix.
<li>
    The one previous category aggregate has now been replaced by some
     nine syntax rules thereby bringing into the syntax the various
     distinctions between array and record aggregates and their various
     rules which were previously expressed by English text.
<li>
    The new category handled_sequence_of_statements avoids much
     repetition in a number of other rules, and clarifies the region of
     text in which a given handler applies.
<li>
    The categories body_stub and renaming_declaration are both broken
     down into named subcategories for ease of exposition.
<li>
    The previous category generic_parameter_declaration which
     confusingly reused other categories from other contexts is now
     replaced by some twenty individual categories describing the various
     classes of generic parameters in a hierarchical manner.
</ul>
<p>
The statistically minded might be interested to observe that Ada 83 is
described by 180 rules whereas Ada 95 has about 270.  However, the rules
introduced for clarity account for about 50 of this increase and so in
real terms the syntax for Ada 95 is about one seventh bigger than Ada 83.
A major part of this increase is simply due to the introduction of
protected types.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=4>
1.4  Classification of Errors
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The classification of errors in Ada 95 is somewhat different to that in
Ada 83.  The primary reason for the new classification is to be more
realistic and practical regarding the possible consequences of undefined
behavior.  The effect is often to indicate that the range of possible
outcomes of a program execution is less than the Ada 83 rules led one to
believe (in practice there is little change).
</p>
<p>
The most significant new classification is the introduction of the
category called bounded errors.  The general idea is that the behavior is
not fully determined but nevertheless falls within well-defined bounds.
Many errors which were previously classed as erroneous (which implied
completely undefined behavior) are now simply bounded errors.  An obvious
example is the consequence of evaluating an uninitialized scalar
variable; this could result in the raising of Program_Error or
Constraint_Error or the production of a value not in the subtype, see
[RM95 4.4, 11.6].
</p>
<p>
A rather different approach is taken regarding unportable behavior.  A
program whose behavior depends upon some order of evaluation is no longer
classed as incorrect but simply as being not portable.  As a consequence
the category of error called incorrect order dependences is deleted.
</p>
<p>
   There are also cases where the language has been changed so that a
run-time error in Ada 83 is now detected during compilation in Ada 95.
Thus static subtype matching is required in some situations as described
in 3.9.
</p>
<p>
   The language also allows a compiler to have different modes of
operation according to the detection of suspicious situations such as too
many warnings.  This specifically meets one of the requirements for early
detection of errors where possible.
</p>

1.5  Requirements Summary
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The requirements
<pre>
     R 2.1-A(1) - Incorporate Approved Commentaries

     R 2.1-A(2) - Review Other Presentation Suggestions
</pre>
are both addressed by the extra attention given to terminology and by the
incorporation of improved text recommended by the Ada Rapporteur Group.
</p>
<p>
   The requirements
<pre>
     R 2.1-B(1) - Maintain Format of Existing Standard

     R 2.1-C(1) - Machine-Readable Version of the Standard
</pre>
have also been met as explained in 1.2.  Furthermore, the requirement
<pre>
     R 2.2-B(1) - Understandability
</pre>
is also addressed by the greatly improved terminology as well as by the
revisions to the syntax described in 1.3.  However, it should be noted
that, as expressed in [DoD 90], this particular requirement was perhaps
slanted more at certain specific language features rather than clarity of
description in general.
</p>
<p>
In the case of error detection the requirement and study topic
<pre>
     R 2.3-A(2) - Limit Consequences of Erroneous Execution

     S 2.3-A(1) - Improve Early Detection of Errors
</pre>
are addressed by the introduction of the concept of bounded errors and
more compilation checking such as static subtype matching.
