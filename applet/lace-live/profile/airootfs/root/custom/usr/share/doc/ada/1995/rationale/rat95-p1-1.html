<h1>
I   Evolution of Ada 95
</h1>


<p>
Ada is a modern programming language suitable for those
application areas which benefit from the discipline of
organized development, that is, Software Engineering; it is
a general purpose language with special applicability to
real-time and embedded systems.  Ada was originally
developed by an international design team in response to
requirements issued by the United States Department of
Defense [DoD 78].
</p>
<p>
   Ada 95 is a revised version of Ada updating the 1983 ANSI
Ada standard [ANSI 83] and the equivalent 1987 ISO standard
[ISO 87] in accordance with ANSI and ISO procedures.  (ANSI
is the American National Standards Institute and ISO is the
International Standards Organization.)  This present
document describes the overall Rationale for the revision
and includes tutorial information for the new features.

<h2>
I.1  The Revision Process
</h2>
</a>

<p>
Although Ada was originally designed to provide a single
flexible yet portable language for real-time embedded
systems to meet the needs of the US DoD, its domain of
application has expanded to include many other areas, such
as large-scale information systems, distributed systems,
scientific computation, and systems programming.
Furthermore, its user base has expanded to include all major
defense agencies of the Western world, the whole of the
aerospace community and increasingly many areas in civil and
private sectors such as telecommunications, process control
and monitoring systems.  Indeed, the expansion in the civil
sector is such that civil applications now generate the
dominant revenues of many vendors.
</p>
<p>
   After some years of use and many implementations, a
decision was made in 1988 to undertake a revision to Ada,
leading to an updated ANSI/ISO standard.  It is normal
practice to automatically reconsider such standards every 5
or 10 years and to determine whether they should be
abandoned, reaffirmed as they are, or updated.  In the case
of Ada, an update was deemed appropriate.
</p>
<p>
   To understand the process it should be explained that
ANSI, as the US national standards body, originally proposed
that Ada become an ISO standard.  It is normal practice that
ANSI, as the originating body, should sponsor a revised
standard as necessary.  The US DoD acted as the agent of
ANSI in managing the development of the revised standard.
Within the US DoD, the Ada Joint Program Office (AJPO) is
responsible for Ada and the Ada Board is a federal advisory
committee which advises the AJPO.
</p>
<p>
   The revision effort began in January 1988 when the Ada
Board was asked to prepare a recommendation to the AJPO on
the most appropriate standardization process to use in
developing a revised Ada standard, known in the interim as
Ada 9X.  The recommendation [DoD 88] was delivered in
September 1988 to Virginia Castor, the then Director of the
Ada Joint Program Office, who subsequently established the
Ada 9X Project for conducting the revision of the Ada
Standard.  Christine M Anderson was appointed Project
Manager in October 1988.  Close consultation with ISO was
important to ensure that the needs of the whole world-wide
Ada community (and not just the defense community) were
taken into account and to ensure the timely adoption by ISO
of the new standard.  Accordingly a Memorandum of
Understanding was established between the US DoD and ISO
[ISO 90].
</p>
<p>
   The Ada 9X program consists of three main phases: the
determination of the Requirements for the revised language;
the actual Development of the definition of the revised
language; and the Transition into use from Ada 83 to Ada 9X.
</p>
<p>
   The output of the Requirements Definition phase was the
Ada 9X Requirements document [DoD 90], which specified the
revision needs which had to be addressed.  The
Mapping/Revision phase defined the changes to the standard
to meet those requirements; it achieved this in practice of
course by defining the new standard.
</p>
<p>
   The scope of the changes was guided by the overall
objective of the Ada 9X effort [DoD 89a]:
<pre>
     Revise ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A-1983 to reflect current
     essential requirements with minimum negative
     impact and maximum positive impact to the Ada
     community.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   It is probably fair to observe that the changes which
were deemed necessary are somewhat greater than might have
been foreseen when the project first started in 1988.
However, technology and man's understanding do not stand
still and the changes now incorporated are very appropriate
to the foreseen needs of a modern language for Software
Engineering into the 21st Century.
</p>

<h2>
I.2  The Requirements
</h2>
</a>

<p>
The development of the requirements was a somewhat iterative
process with a number of sub-phases.  First, the community
of users was invited to submit Revision Requests, secondly,
these were sorted and analyzed in order to determine what
was really implied by the requests, and finally, a coherent
set of requirements was written.
</p>
<p>
   Establishing the level of the requirements needed care.
Quite naturally an individual user would often perceive a
need in a manner which reflected a symptom of an underlying
problem rather than the problem itself.  It was very
important that the requirements reflected the essence of the
problem rather than what might in effect be simply one
user's suggested solution to a part of a problem.  One
reason for this concern was to ensure that better, perhaps
deeper and simpler, changes were not excluded by shallow
requirements.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases a complete understanding of a requirement
could not be established and this led to the introduction of
Study Topics.  As its name implies a Study Topic described
an area where something ought to be done but for some reason
the feasibility of a solution was in doubt; perhaps the
needs were changing rapidly or there were conflicting needs
or implementing technology was unstable or it was simply
that we had an incomplete understanding of some basic
principles.
</p>
<p>
   The general goal of the revision was thus to satisfy all
of the Requirements and to satisfy as many and as much of
the Study Topics as possible.  Any unsatisfied Study Topics
would be set aside for further consideration for a future
Ada 0X (that is the next revision due perhaps around 2005).

</p>
<p>
   The requirements document described 41 Requirements and
22 Study Topics.  These were divided into a number of
chapters which themselves form two broad groups.  The first
group covered topics of widespread applicability, whereas
the second group addressed more specialized topics.
</p>
<p>
   The first group consisted of the need to support
International Character Sets (originally identified by
several nations in the 1987 ISO standardization process),
support for Programming Paradigms (Object Orientation was
included in this category), Real-Time requirements,
requirements for System Programming (such as Unsigned
Integers), and General requirements.  This last topic
included specific matters such as error detection and
general considerations of efficiency, simplicity and
consistency; examples of a number of individually minor but
irritating aspects of Ada 83 which fall into this category
were given in an appendix.
</p>
<p>
   The second, specialized, group consisted of requirements
for Parallel Processing, Distributed Processing, Safety-
Critical Applications, Information Systems, and Scientific
and Mathematical Applications.
</p>
<p>
  The breadth of these specialized requirements raised the
specter of a language embracing so many application areas
that it would become too costly to implement in its entirety
for every architecture.  On the other hand, one of the
strengths of Ada is its uniformity and the last thing
desired was a plethora of uncontrolled subsets.
Accordingly, the Requirements document recommended the
concept of a Core language plus a small number of
Specialized Needs Annexes as a sensible way forward (with
emphasis on keeping the number of such annexes very small).
All validated compilers would have to implement the Core
language and vendors could choose to implement zero, one or
more annexes according to the needs of their selected market
places.
</p>
<p>
   The Requirements document also included general guidance
on the approach to be taken to avoid unnecessary disruption
to the Ada community.  This covered vital matters such as
the ease of implementation, object code efficiency, keeping
a balance between change and need, and upward compatibility.
It finally stressed that support for reliability, safety and
long-term maintainability should continue to take precedence
over short-term coding convenience.
</p>
<p>
   Of all these requirements there was strong emphasis on
the overriding goal of upward compatibility in order to
preserve existing investment by the Ada community as a
whole.

<h2>
I.3  The Main User Needs
</h2>
</a>

<p>
The Requirements reflected a number of underlying User Needs
which had become apparent over the years since Ada was first
defined.  Apart from a small number of very specific matters
such as the character set issue, the specialized areas and
generally tidying up minor inconsistencies, four main areas
stood out as needing attention:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
     Interfacing.  Ada 83 recognizes the importance of being
     able to interface to external systems by the provision
     of features such as representation clauses and pragmas.
     Nevertheless, it was sometimes not easy to interface
     certain Ada 83 programs to other language systems.  A
     general need was felt for a more flexible approach
     allowing, for instance, the secure manipulation of
     references and the passing of procedures as parameters.
     An example arises when interfacing into GUI's where it
     is often necessary to pass a procedure as a parameter
     for call-back.
<li>
    Programming by Extension.  This is closely allied to
     reusability.  Although Ada's package and generic
     capability are an excellent foundation, nevertheless
     experience with the OO paradigm in other languages had
     shown the advantages of being able to extend a program
     without any modification to existing proven components.
     Not only does this save disturbing existing software
     thus eliminating the risk of introducing errors but it
     also reduces recompilation costs.
<li>
    Program Libraries.  The Ada program library brings
     important benefits by extending the strong typing
     across the boundaries between separately compiled
     units.  However, the flat nature of the Ada 83 library
     gave problems of visibility control; for example, it
     prevented two library packages from sharing a full view
     of a private type.  A common consequence of the flat
     structure was that packages become large and
     monolithic.  This hindered understanding and increased
     the cost of recompilation.  A more flexible and
     hierarchical structure was necessary.
<li>
    Tasking.  The Ada rendezvous paradigm is a useful model
     for the abstract description of many tasking problems.
     But experience had shown that a more static monitor-
     like approach was also desirable for common shared-data
     access applications.  Furthermore, the Ada priority
     model needed revision in order to enable users to take
     advantage of the greater understanding of scheduling
     theory which had emerged since Ada 83 was defined.
</ul>
<p>
   The main changes incorporated into Ada 95 reflect the
response to the Requirements in meeting these four key needs
while at the same time meeting an overriding need for upward
compatibility in order to minimize the effort and cost of
transition.
</p>

<a name=4>
<h2>
I.4  The Approach
</h2>
</a>

<p>
In responding to the revision requirements, the Revision
team followed the inspiration of Jean Ichbiah (who led the
original design team), both in remaining faithful to the
principles underlying the original Ada design, and in the
approach to the revision process.  To quote Dr Ichbiah in
his introduction to John Barnes' textbook on Ada [Barnes
82]:
<pre>
     Clearly, further progress can only come by a
     reappraisal of implicit assumptions underlying
     certain compromises.  Here is the major
     contradiction in any design work.  On the one
     hand, one can only reach an harmonious integration
     of several features by immersing oneself into the
     logic of the existing parts; it is only in this
     way that one can achieve a perfect combination.
     On the other hand, this perception of perfection,
     and the implied acceptance of certain unconscious
     assumptions, will prevent further progress.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Wherever possible, enhanced functionality in Ada 95 has
been achieved by seeking and eliminating such unnecessary
assumptions, thereby permitting the generalization of
features already in Ada, and the removal of special cases
and restrictions.  A careful analysis was made of Ada 83, of
language study notes prepared during the original design
process and of the many Ada Issues and other comments that
have since been received.  Based on this analysis, and on
the Ada community's experience in implementing and using Ada
during the past ten years, the team identified limitations
that, while they were included to simplify implementations
and/or to lower risk when the language was first
standardized, are no longer necessary.  They also drew upon
the wealth of practical experience gained during the 1980's
in the use of object-oriented design methods, object-
oriented programming languages, and real-time programming
made possible by Ada.
</p>
<p>
   The resulting Ada 95 revision is upwardly compatible for
virtually all existing Ada 83 applications.  Most
incompatibilities are restricted to pathological
combinations of features that are rarely used in practice.
Total upward compatibility would not have allowed the
correction of certain errors and certainly would not have
allowed the enhancements needed to satisfy many of the
requirements.  Indeed, as discussed in Appendix A in more
detail, no language revision has ever achieved total upward
compatibility.  The careful attention to this issue in the
design of Ada 95 means that the expected transition costs
for existing Ada programs are anticipated to be very low
indeed.
</p>
<p>
   Following the guidance of the Requirements document, Ada
95 comprises a Core language, which must be implemented in
its entirety, plus several Specialized Needs Annexes which
provide extended features for specific application areas.
These Annexes provide standard definitions for application-
specific packages, pragmas, attributes, and capacity and
performance characteristics of implementations.  The Annexes
address the following areas: Systems Programming, Real-Time
Systems, Distributed Systems, Information Systems, Numerics,
and Safety and Security.
</p>
<p>
   It should be noted that the Core language includes a
considerably extended predefined environment covering
important functionality such as mathematical functions and
string handling.  Much of the functionality of this
predefined environment and the specialized annexes is
already provided by implementations of Ada 83 but in non-
standard ways; providing this within the standard will thus
increase portability between implementations.

<h2>
I.5  Using this Document
</h2>
</a>

<p>
This document provides a description of the main features of
Ada 95 and the rationale for the changes from Ada 83.  It
follows the inspiration of the rationale for Ada 83 [IBFW
86] by blending exposition with explanation.
</p>
<p>
   It is in four parts, this first part is designed to give
the reader a general appreciation for the scope and
objectives of Ada 95 and its major features.  Chapter II
highlights the main changes - primarily the four key areas
outlined in I.3.  The intent is to provide a technically
oriented management overview illustrating, with examples,
the prime benefits of Ada 95 with respect to Ada 83.  By
contrast, Chapter III provides an overview of the whole
language in a discursive style and introduces new
terminology where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
   The second and third parts take the discussion a step
further.  The second part covers the Core language per se;
it addresses those important features not discussed in this
first part and gives more detail of the rationale including
alternatives that were considered and rejected.  The third
part similarly addresses the predefined environment and the
various Specialized Needs Annexes.
</p>
<p>
  Finally the fourth part contains three appendices.
Appendix X summarizes the incompatibilities thereby giving
guidance to existing Ada 83 programmers in order to smooth
their transition to Ada 95.  Appendix Y summarizes the main
differences between the final International Standard (which
this edition of the rationale describes) and the previous
two drafts, the Draft International Standard [DIS 94] and
the Committee Draft [CD 93].  Appendix Z summarizes the
original requirements and briefly analyzes how they have
been met by Ada 95.
</p>
<p>
   It is generally assumed that the reader is familiar with
Ada 83.  This first part should be read before approaching
the Ada 95 Reference Manual [RM95] which should then be read
in parallel with Parts Two and Three.  It should also be
noted that the general intent of all parts of this document
is to address the broad picture.  The rationale for minute
detail is admirably addressed in the Annotated Ada 95
Reference Manual [AARM] which is a version of [RM95]
including embedded non-normative discussion mainly of
interest to language experts and compiler writers.
</p>
<p>
   The chapters in this first part have Roman numbers; the
chapters in Parts Two and Three have numbers and letters
essentially corresponding to the sections and annexes of [RM
95].  The appendices in Part Four are called X, Y and Z to
avoid confusion with the annex chapters.  All chapters thus
have a unique identifier for ease of cross reference.
