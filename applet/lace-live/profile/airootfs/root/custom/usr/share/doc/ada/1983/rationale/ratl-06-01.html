<H2>CHAPTER 6: Access Types</H2>

<H3><a name="6.1">6.1 Introduction</a></H3>

The notion  of access type encompasses the concept of objects that are
dynamically created  during the  execution of  a program.  In general,
neither the  number of  such objects, nor their names, can be fixed in
advance.
<p>
The inclusion  of such  a  feature  in  a  language  raises  what  are
traditionally some  of the  most difficult  issues in language design,
and indeed  in programming.  Accordingly, the  first section  of  this
chapter is  devoted to an overview of these issues. This will serve as
background for an exposition of the approach adopted in Ada.
