<H1>E.4 Remote Subprogram Calls</H1>
<DIV Class="paranum">1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7126"></A><A NAME="I7127"></A><A NAME="I7128"></A><A NAME="I7129"></A><A NAME="I7130"></A>A 
<I>remote subprogram call</I> is a subprogram call that invokes the execution 
of a subprogram in another partition. The partition that originates the 
remote subprogram call is the <I>calling partition</I>, and the partition 
that executes the corresponding subprogram body is the <I>called partition</I>. 
Some remote procedure calls are allowed to return prior to the completion 
of subprogram execution. These are called <I>asynchronous remote procedure 
calls</I>.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">There are three different 
ways of performing a remote subprogram call:&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">3</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>As a direct call on a (remote) subprogram 
explicitly declared in a remote call interface;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">4</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>As an indirect call through a value 
of a remote access-to-subprogram type;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">5</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>As a dispatching call with a controlling 
operand designated by a value of a remote access-to-class-wide type. 
</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">6</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The first way of calling corresponds to a <I>static</I> 
binding between the calling and the called partition. The latter two 
ways correspond to a <I>dynamic</I> binding between the calling and the 
called partition.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">A remote call interface library unit (see <A HREF="RM-E-2-3.html">E.2.3</A>) 
defines the remote subprograms or remote access types used for remote 
subprogram calls.&nbsp;</DIV>

<H4 Class="centered">Legality Rules</H4>
<DIV Class="paranum">8</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">In a dispatching call with two or more controlling 
operands, if one controlling operand is designated by a value of a remote 
access-to-class-wide type, then all shall be.&nbsp;</DIV>

<H4 Class="centered">Dynamic Semantics</H4>
<DIV Class="paranum">9</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7131"></A><A NAME="I7132"></A><A NAME="I7133"></A>For 
the execution of a remote subprogram call, subprogram parameters (and 
later the results, if any) are passed using a stream-oriented representation 
(see <A HREF="RM-13-13-1.html">13.13.1</A>) which is suitable for transmission 
between partitions. This action is called <I>marshalling</I>. <I>Unmarshalling</I> 
is the reverse action of reconstructing the parameters or results from 
the stream-oriented representation. Marshalling is performed initially 
as part of the remote subprogram call in the calling partition; unmarshalling 
is done in the called partition. After the remote subprogram completes, 
marshalling is performed in the called partition, and finally unmarshalling 
is done in the calling partition.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">10</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7134"></A><A NAME="I7135"></A>A <I>calling 
stub</I> is the sequence of code that replaces the subprogram body of 
a remotely called subprogram in the calling partition. A <I>receiving 
stub</I> is the sequence of code (the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;) that receives 
a remote subprogram call on the called partition and invokes the appropriate 
subprogram body.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">11</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7136"></A>Remote subprogram calls are executed 
at most once, that is, if the subprogram call returns normally, then 
the called subprogram's body was executed exactly once.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">12</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The task executing a remote subprogram call blocks 
until the subprogram in the called partition returns, unless the call 
is asynchronous. For an asynchronous remote procedure call, the calling 
task can become ready before the procedure in the called partition returns.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">13</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7137"></A>If a construct containing a remote 
call is aborted, the remote subprogram call is <I>cancelled</I>. Whether 
the execution of the remote subprogram is immediately aborted as a result 
of the cancellation is implementation defined.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">14</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">If a remote subprogram call is received by a called 
partition before the partition has completed its elaboration, the call 
is kept pending until the called partition completes its elaboration 
(unless the call is cancelled by the calling partition prior to that).</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">15</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">If an exception is propagated by a remotely called 
subprogram, and the call is not an asynchronous call, the corresponding 
exception is reraised at the point of the remote subprogram call. For 
an asynchronous call, if the remote procedure call returns prior to the 
completion of the remotely called subprogram, any exception is lost.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">16</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The exception Communication_Error (see <A HREF="RM-E-5.html">E.5</A>) 
is raised if a remote call cannot be completed due to difficulties in 
communicating with the called partition.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">17</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7138"></A><A NAME="I7139"></A>All forms 
of remote subprogram calls are potentially blocking operations (see <A HREF="RM-9-5-1.html">9.5.1</A>). 
</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">18/1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I7140"></A><A NAME="I7141"></A>In a remote 
subprogram call with a formal parameter of a class-wide type, a check 
is made that the tag of the actual parameter identifies a tagged type 
declared in a declared-pure or shared passive library unit, or in the 
visible part of a remote types or remote call interface library unit. 
<A NAME="I7142"></A>Program_Error is raised if this check fails. In a 
remote function call which returns a class-wide type, the same check 
is made on the function result.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">19</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal"><A NAME="I7143"></A><A NAME="I7144"></A>In a dispatching 
call with two or more controlling operands that are designated by values 
of a remote access-to-class-wide type, a check is made (in addition to 
the normal Tag_Check &mdash; see <A HREF="RM-11-5.html">11.5</A>) that 
all the remote access-to-class-wide values originated from Access <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-4-1-4.html#S0100">attribute_reference</A></SPAN>s 
that were evaluated by tasks of the same active partition. <A NAME="I7145"></A>Constraint_Error 
is raised if this check fails.&nbsp;</DIV>

<H4 Class="centered">Implementation Requirements</H4>
<DIV Class="paranum">20</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">The implementation of remote subprogram calls shall 
conform to the PCS interface as defined by the specification of the language-defined 
package System.RPC (see <A HREF="RM-E-5.html">E.5</A>). The calling stub 
shall use the Do_RPC procedure unless the remote procedure call is asynchronous 
in which case Do_APC shall be used. On the receiving side, the corresponding 
receiving stub shall be invoked by the RPC-receiver.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">20.1/1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to shared variables in shared passive 
library units, the execution of the corresponding subprogram body of 
a synchronous remote procedure call is considered to be part of the execution 
of the calling task. The execution of the corresponding subprogram body 
of an asynchronous remote procedure call proceeds in parallel with the 
calling task and does not signal the next action of the calling task 
(see <A HREF="RM-9-10.html">9.10</A>).&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="NotesHeader">NOTES</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">21</DIV>
<DIV Class="Notes">6&nbsp;&nbsp;A given active partition can both make 
and receive remote subprogram calls. Thus, an active partition can act 
as both a client and a server.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">22</DIV>
<DIV Class="Notes">7&nbsp;&nbsp;If a given exception is propagated by 
a remote subprogram call, but the exception does not exist in the calling 
partition, the exception can be handled by an <B>others</B> choice or 
be propagated to and handled by a third partition.&nbsp;</DIV>
