<H2>CHAPTER 16: Input-Output</H2>

<H3><a name="16.5">16.5 Text Files</a></H3>

As  stated   earlier,  in  the  case  of  TEXT_IO  the  external  file
essentially comprises a sequence of characters. We require, therefore,
a number  of subprograms  that can map the various different Ada types
onto the  type character.  In addition,  there is a need to be able to
specify the  format of  the externally  held item  - in the case of an
integer it  could be in decimal or some other base, it might be padded
with leading  blanks to  fit a  fixed field,  and so  on. Furthermore,
there are  many circumstances  in which it is convenient to be able to
use default  formats, in  order to avoid having to supply the detailed
format on each individual call.

<H3><BR><a name="16.5.1">16.5.1 Overloading PUT and GET</a></H3>

The use of PUT and GET for all types (and all formats) is an excellent
example of  the usefulness  of overloading. Without overloading (as is
the situation  with <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol  60</a>), we  would need  to declare differently
named procedures for each type and formatting style:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
PUT_CHARACTER
PUT_STRING
PUT_INTEGER
PUT_FLOAT
...
PUT_INTEGER_FORMATTED
...
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Thus in Algol 60 we had to write something like
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
integer I;
real X;
...
PUTSTRING("results are:  ");  PUTINT(I);  PUTREAL(X);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
whereas in Ada we can much more neatly write
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
I :  INTEGER;
X :  REAL;
...
PUT("results are:  ");  PUT(I);  PUT(X);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Moreover, without overloading it would be almost impossible to provide
facilities for  arbitrary user-defined  numeric and enumeration types.
With overloading  we are  able to  use PUT for the output of all types
and all formats; identification of the proper procedure is resolved by
the normal rules, and no particular problems arise.
<p>
However, even  with overloading,  there are  two  limitations  of  the
strict procedural  approach. First  the language  does  not  have  any
concept equivalent  to the straightening of Algol 68. If straightening
were provided,  a procedure such as PUT (which is defined for the type
INTEGER) would  be automatically  extended (by iteration) to arrays of
integers.  Similarly  if  PUT  were  defined  for  the  types  of  the
components of  a record,  it would also be defined for the record type
itself.  The   second  limitation  concerns  parameter  lists.  It  is
traditional  to  perform  several  output  operations  with  a  single
statement but  this is  not permitted  by a  strictly procedural form.
Conceivably one  could use  another separator  (say  //  )  to  permit
multiple argument lists for a procedure:
<p>
<PRE>    PUT("results are:  " //  I  // X);           -- not in Ada</PRE>
<p>
For simplicity neither straightening nor multiple parameter lists have
been introduced.  The choice  of short  identifiers such  as PUT  much
reduces the inconvenience of the procedural form.

<H3><BR><a name="16.5.2">16.5.2 Generic Treatment of Numeric and Enumeration Types</a></H3>

It would  be possible  to provide  procedures  PUT  and  GET  for  the
predefined numeric  types: INTEGER,  LONG_INTEGER, FLOAT,  LONG_FLOAT,
and so  on. However, this would not be in the style of Ada, which, for
the sake  of abstraction  and  portability,  encourages  the  user  to
declare application-specific numeric types such as:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type REAL is digits 10;
R :  REAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
It is desirable to be able to write
<p>
<PRE>    PUT(R);</PRE>
<p>
where the  particular PUT has formatting and other properties relevant
to the type R, rather than, say,
<p>
<PRE>    PUT(FLOAT(R));</PRE>
<p>
which introduces  portability problems because the default format will
depend upon the properties of the predefined type FLOAT, and this will
of course vary with the implementation.
<p>
A convenient  solution  is  provided  by  generic  packages  that  are
declared within TEXT_IO and are visible outside of this package. There
are four  of these,  covering integer  types,  floating  types,  fixed
types, and  enumeration types.  Each of these packages has one generic
parameter that  determines the  particular type.  Thus in  the case of
floating types the package has the form:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type NUM is digits &lt;&gt;;
package FLOAT_IO is
  ...
  procedure PUT(ITEM :  in NUM;   ...  );
  ...
end FLOAT_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The user  can then  instantiate this generic package in the usual way,
and thereby obtain the desired effect:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  use TEXT_IO;
  package REAL_IO is new FLOAT_IO(NUM =&gt;  REAL);
  use REAL_IO;
begin
  PUT(R);                       -- calls REAL_IO.PUT
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="16.5.3">16.5.3 Use of Default Parameters for Formatting</a></H3>

It is  important for  the user to have good control over the format of
output items. This applies particularly to the numeric types, and to a
lesser extent  to enumeration  types. On  the other  hand, it is often
convenient to  use some  default format  in order to avoid the tedious
repetition of  standard parameters.  The ability  to  provide  default
expressions for  in parameters  enables such facilities to be provided
in a  convenient manner.  We will  illustrate the  techniques with the
packages for  integer and enumeration types; the same principles apply
to the real types.
<p>
The specification of INTEGER_IO is
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type NUM is range &lt;&gt;;
package INTEGER_IO is

  DEFAULT_WIDTH :  FIELD  :=  NUM'WIDTH;
  DEFAULT_BASE   :  NUMBER_BASE  :=  10;
  ...
  procedure PUT      (ITEM :    in NUM;
               WIDTH :     in FIELD  :=  DEFAULT_WIDTH;
               BASE  :     in NUMBER_BASE  :=  DEFAULT_BASE);
  ...
end INTEGER_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For simplicity  we have  just shown  the procedure  PUT that takes the
default output file; there is another procedure PUT with an additional
and leading  parameter that gives the file explicitly, as discussed in
<a href="ratl-16-03.html#16.3.2">16.3.2</a>.
<p>
The parameters of PUT are as follows:
<p>

<center><table border cellpadding=6>
<tr><th align=left>ITEM</th><td>
The numeric value to be output.
</td></tr>
<tr><th align=left>WIDTH</th><td>
The width  of the  field in  which the  value is to be  placed.
The type  mark FIELD is just a suitable subtype of INTEGER. The
value is  right justified  in the  field, with  padding leading
spaces and  a minus  sign if  appropriate. If  the field is not
wide enough, then it is expanded as necessary.
</td></tr>
<tr><th align=left>BASE</th><td>
The number  base to  be used. If this is 10 then normal decimal
notation is used, otherwise the syntax of based literal is used
(with  any  letters  in  upper  case).  Again,  the  type  mark
NUMBER_BASE, is a suitable subtype of INTEGER.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>

The default  expressions for  the format  parameters should  be noted.
They are  the values  of the  variables DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_BASE
which are  also declared  in the  visible part  of the generic package
INTEGER_IO. The  initial  value  of  DEFAULT_WIDTH  is  the  attribute
NUM'WIDTH - this gives a field just large enough to hold all values of
the type,  including a prefixed minus sign or space. The initial value
of DEFAULT_BASE is 10.
<p>
We now  have the desired behavior. The format can be specified on each
call, or,  alternatively, one  or both  parameters can  be omitted, in
which case the relevant defaults will be obtained.
<p>
The fact that default expressions for parameters are evaluated on each
use is  very important.  It means  that  the  current  values  of  the
variables DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_BASE are always used, and not just
their initial  values. As  a consequence,  the default  values can  be
changed dynamically.  Moreover, since  the variables DEFAULT_WIDTH and
DEFAULT_BASE  are   declared  in  the  visible  part  of  the  package
INTEGER_IO, the  user can  change them  by direct assignment. The user
can now write
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  type INDEX is range 0 .. 511;
  package INDEX_IO is new INTEGER_IO(NUM =&gt;  INDEX);
  use INDEX_IO;
  ...
  I :  INDEX;
begin
  I :=  471;

  PUT(I);                       --  b471
  PUT(I, 6);                    --  bbb471
  PUT(I, BASE =&gt;  8);           --  8#727#

  INDEX_IO.DEFAULT_WIDTH :=  7;
  INDEX_IO.DEFAULT_BASE   :=  8;

  PUT(I);                       --  b8#727#
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
(The letter b in the above comments stands for one blank space.)
<p>
Note that  INDEX'WIDTH (the  initial DEFAULT_WIDTH)  is 4; this allows
for three digits plus a leading space. It is important to realize that
the WIDTH  attribute is  a property of the subtype and not of the base
type - this is very appropriate, because the base type will be derived
from one  of the  predefined types,  and  could  indeed  be  the  type INTEGER; it  could not  be appropriate  to use the WIDTH pertaining to
this, since it would vary with the implementation.
<p>
Observe also that the package name has been used when assigning to the
defaults. This  will be  necessary if  a number  of instances of these
generic packages have been declared.
<p>
In the case of ENUMERATION_IO we have
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ENUM is (&lt;&gt;);
package ENUMERATION_IO is

  DEFAULT_WIDTH    :  FIELD  :=  0;
  DEFAULT_SETTING  :  TYPE_SET  :=  UPPER_CASE;
  ...
  procedure PUT      (ITEM :    in ENUM;
               WIDTH :     in FIELD  :=  DEFAULT_WIDTH;
               SET   :     in TYPE_SET  :=  DEFAULT_SETTING);
  ...
end ENUMERATION_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here the  format parameters  control the  field width  and the case of
characters (lower  case or  upper case,  with upper  being the  norm).
TYPE_SET is itself an enumeration type declared in TEXT_IO as follows:
<p>
<PRE>    type TYPE_SET is (LOWER_CASE, UPPER_CASE);</PRE>
<p>
The behavior is as expected. Values are by default output in a minimal
field -  since the  default  width  is  zero  -  and  in  upper  case.
Furthermore, the  user can provide an explicit format, and also change
the default. Padding is by trailing blanks.
