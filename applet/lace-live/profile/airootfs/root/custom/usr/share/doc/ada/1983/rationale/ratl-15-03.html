<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.3">15.3 Multiple Representations and Change of Representation</a></H3>

When a  program has  to deal  with objects  that exist  on an external
medium, one is faced with the problem of multiple representations. For
example, records  may be  stored in  a packed  form on  a file;  but a
program may  need faster  access to  the record  components  when  the
information is processed, and hence may require an unpacked form. This
is a classic situation in which different representations for the same
objects are wanted.
<p>
Although the  details of the alternate representations are not part of
the logical  properties, we  will show with the following example that
the knowledge  of  the  existence  of  alternate  representations  is,
itself, a logical property.

<H3><BR><a name="15.3.1">15.3.1 A Canonical Example of Changes of Representation</a></H3>

Consider the problem of converting data from some external medium into
a form  ready to  be output  onto another  external medium.  Both data
objects belong  to the  same enumeration type, but they have different
representations, each of which is prescribed by the outside world. The
following program  fragment  gives  a  hypothetical  formulation  (not
following the Ada syntax) for the required procedure:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure CONVERT is
  -- declarations of the logical properties:

  type DAY is (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN);
  X, Y :  DAY;

  -- representation clauses (not in the Ada syntax):

  representation FORM_A of DAY is
    (MON =&gt;  0,    TUE   =&gt;  1,  WED   =&gt;  2,
     THU =&gt;  3,    FRI   =&gt;  4,  SAT   =&gt;  5,  SUN  =&gt;  6);
  representation FORM_B of DAY is
    (MON =&gt;  1,    TUE   =&gt;  2,  WED   =&gt;  3,
     THU =&gt;  4,    FRI   =&gt;  5,  SAT   =&gt;  6,  SUN  =&gt;  7);
  for X use representation FORM_A;
  for Y use representation FORM_B;

  -- end of representation clauses (in hypothetical syntax)
begin
  ...
  Y :=  X;
  ...
end CONVERT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In trying  to establish  the correctness  of the  above procedure, one
finds that  the information contained in the logical declarations of X
and Y  does not  suffice. It can only be concluded that X and Y are of
type DAY.  To complete  the  correctness  proof  (that  conversion  is
properly effected) it is necessary to consider representation clauses,
and hence  to violate  the separation  principle mentioned earlier. We
are thus  led to the conclusion that any attempt to hide the existence
of multiple representations at the logical level ultimately leads to a
violation of the separation principle.

<H3><BR><a name="15.3.2">15.3.2 One Type - One Representation Principle</a></H3>

It  is   natural  and   desirable  to   use  type  as  a  carrier  for
representation. The  approach adopted  in Ada  is  to  have  a  unique
representation  of   each  type   and  to  select  the  representation
explicitly by  representation clauses.  This results  in a significant
simplification, since  the user  does not  have to  think in  terms of
multiple representations for a single type.
<p>
If we  need two  different representations,  two different  types  are
therefore required,  although these  two types  should have  identical
logical properties:  the solution  to this  problem is  to use derived
types. For example, a type B can be derived from a type A by declaring
<p>
<PRE>    type B is new A;</PRE>
<p>
Since B  derives its  characteristics from A, both types have the same
characteristics, for  example the  same components.  However, they are
distinct  types   and  it  is  hence  possible  to  specify  different
representations for  A and  for B.  Change of  representation  can  be
achieved by explicit conversion between objects of types A and B since
such conversions  are defined  for derived  types. Derivation  has the
effect of  creating a  type with  the same  characteristics as another
type, without  rewriting its  entire description  (that would define a
distinct type for which no conversions are possible).
<p>
<H4>Note:</H4>
<p>
The one  type -  one representation  principle must  be understood  in
terms of  the knowledge  that the  user has  from  the  existence  (as
opposed to  the details)  of a  representation. It  means  that  if  a
representation is  explicitly specified  for a  type,  then  only  one
representation can be specified for this type. However, in cases where
the representation  is implicitly  selected by the compiler, this does
not  preclude   the  use  of  different  internal  representations  in
different contexts - out of sight of the user.

<H3><BR><a name="15.3.3">15.3.3 Explicit Type Conversion and Change of Representation</a></H3>

The problem of change of representation is now straightforward: it can
be expressed as an explicit type conversion between two derived types.
As explained  in <a href="ratl-07.html#7">Chapter  7</a>, the type conversion appears syntactically
as the  call of  a function  with the  name of  the target  type,  for
example:
<p>
<PRE>    Y :=  EXTERNAL_DAY(X);</PRE>
<p>
in the  conversion problem presented earlier. The full solution may be
properly expressed in Ada as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure CONVERT is
  -- declaration of the logical properties:

  type DAY is (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN);
  type EXTERNAL_DAY is new DAY; -- a derived type

  X :  DAY :=  DAY'FIRST;
  Y :  EXTERNAL_DAY;

  -- representation clauses for the two types:

  for DAY use
    (MON =&gt;  0,    TUE   =&gt;  1,  WED   =&gt;  2,
     THU =&gt;  3,    FRI   =&gt;  4,  SAT   =&gt;  5,  SUN  =&gt;  6);
  for EXTERNAL_DAY use
    (MON =&gt;  1,    TUE   =&gt;  2,  WED   =&gt;  3,
     THU =&gt;  4,    FRI   =&gt;  5,  SAT   =&gt;  6,  SUN  =&gt;  7);

  -- end of representation clauses
begin
  ...
  Y :=  EXTERNAL_DAY(X);
  ...
end CONVERT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The correctness  of this  procedure can  now  be  established  without
violation of the separation principle. First, we have to show that the
program is  correct given  the definition  of X  and  Y:  Initially  X
contains a  value of type DAY; the conversion EXTERNAL_DAY(X) is legal
since the  type EXTERNAL_DAY,  is derived  from  the  type  DAY  -  it
converts the  value of  X into  a value of type EXTERNAL_DAY, which is
finally  assigned   to  Y.   Secondly,  it  must  be  shown  that  the
representations given for DAY and EXTERNAL_DAY are correct.
<p>
The same  simple strategy  would be  used in  the previously mentioned
case  of   conversion  of   a  record   structure  between   a  packed
representation and an unpacked representation:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type OBJECT is
  record
    -- declaration of the components of objects
  end record;

type EXTERNAL_OBJECT is new OBJECT; -- a distinct type derived from
OBJECT

for EXTERNAL_OBJECT use
  record
    ...
    -- definition of the layout of record components
  end record;
X  :  OBJECT;
Y  :  EXTERNAL_OBJECT;
...
X  :=  OBJECT(Y);         -- unpack
...
Y  :=  EXTERNAL_OBJECT(X); -- pack
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>

<H3><BR><a name="15.3.4">15.3.4 Implementation of Representation Changes</a></H3>

Although they  are limited to types that are conformable - having been
declared to  be logically  equivalent -  type conversions  may be very
costly in  some cases.  As an  example consider  a  record  type  with
variants:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type V(D :  BOOLEAN :=  TRUE) is
  record
    case D is
      when TRUE  =&gt;  I  :  INTEGER;
      when FALSE =&gt;  R :  REAL;
    end case;
  end record;

type W is new V;

for V use ...
for W use ...

X  :  V;
Y  :  W;
...
X  :=  V(Y);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The implementation  of the  above assignment  cannot  be  achieved  as
simply as  for a  normal record assignment. It must be done on a field
by field  basis, which  is equivalent  to the following program (apart
from the restriction on assignment to the discriminant):
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X.D :=  Y.D;              -- not legal Ada
case Y.D is
    when TRUE =&gt;  X.I :=  Y.I;
    when FALSE       =&gt;  X.R    :=  Y.R;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Producing  such   code  is  well  within  the  capability  of  present
compilation techniques. Nevertheless it is complex and can be somewhat
costly on  some computers  (note that  there might  be variants within
variants).  Expressing   changes   of   representation   as   explicit
conversions warns  the user  of the  potentially high  cost  of  these
operations.
