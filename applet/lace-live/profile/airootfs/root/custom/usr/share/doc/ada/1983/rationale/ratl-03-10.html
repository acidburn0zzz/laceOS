<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.10">3.10 Short-Circuit Control Forms</a></H3>

The operands  of a boolean expression such as A and B can be evaluated
in any  order. Depending  on the  complexity of  the term B, it may be
more efficient  (on some but not all machines) to evaluate B only when
the term  A has  the value  TRUE.  This  however  is  an  optimization
decision taken  by the  compiler and  it would  be incorrect to assume
that this optimization is always done. In other situations we may want
to express  a conjunction of conditions where each condition should be
evaluated (has meaning) only if the previous condition is satisfied.
<p>
Both of these things may be done with short-circuit control forms such
as:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
if NUMBER /= 0  and then  TOTAL/NUMBER &gt; MEDIAN then
  ...
end if;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Clearly it  would not be proper to express this condition as a boolean
expression using  the and operator, since an exception would be raised
if NUMBER  were zero and the second operand were evaluated. Similarly,
short-circuit disjunctions can be expressed with or else clauses as in
the following example:
<p>
<PRE>    exit when NEXT =  null  or else  NEXT.AGE =  0;
</PRE><p>
In this case the condition following or else will only be evaluated if
the previous condition is not satisfied.
<p>
In <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol  60</a> one  can achieve  the effect  of short-circuit evaluation
only by  use of  conditional expressions, since complete evaluation is
performed otherwise.  This often  leads to constructs that are tedious
to follow:
<p>
<PRE>    if(if NUMBER =  0 then TRUE else TOTAL/NUMBER &gt; MEDIAN) then ...
</PRE><p>
Several languages  do not  define how  boolean conditions  are  to  be
evaluated. As a consequence programs based on short-circuit evaluation
will not  be portable.  This clearly  illustrates the need to separate
boolean operators from short-circuit control forms.
