<H2>CHAPTER 11: General Program Structure - Visibility and Overloading</H2>

<H3><a name="11.4">11.4 Overloading</a></H3>

In Ada,  every use  of a  simple name or operator symbol is understood
with reference to an (explicit or implicit) declaration of the name or
symbol. In  the case  of types,  variables, and constants, at most one
such declaration  can be  visible at  any one point in the program. In
the case  of subprograms,  enumeration literals, and entries, however,
several declarations may be simultaneously visible. An occurrence of a
subprogram name,  such as  PUT or  "&#42;", may  therefore refer to one of
several simultaneously  visible declarations.  The  name  or  operator
symbol is then said to be overloaded.

<H3><BR><a name="11.4.1">11.4.1 Overloading of Operators</a></H3>

The overloading  of operators  is a  situation familiar  also in other
languages, and  it illustrates  the main  reason for  the existence of
overloading in Ada. Consider, for example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
I, J, K :  INTEGER;
X, Y, Z :  REAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
It is then possible to write the statements
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
K  :=  I&#42;J;
Z  :=  X&#42;Y;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
in which the operator symbol "&#42;" refers in the first statement to
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER) return INTEGER;</PRE>
<p>
and in the second statement to
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  REAL) return REAL;</PRE>
<p>
The functions  that  implement  integer  multiplication  and  floating
multiplication are  represented by  the same  symbol because  they are
different  implementations   of  the   same  abstract  operation:  the
operation of multiplication.
<p>
The  overloading  of  predefined  operators  has  been  a  feature  of
programming languages  ever since  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a>. But Ada also permits users
to define  new data types, for example COMPLEX or RATIONAL. Since much
of the  power of  the language comes from its extensibility, and since
proper use  of that  extensibility requires  that we  make  as  little
distinction as  possible between predefined and user-defined types, it
is natural  that Ada  also permits  new operations  to be  defined, by
declaring new  overloadings of  the operator symbols. Therefore, since
the operation  of  abstract  multiplication  applies  to  complex  and
rational numbers, one would expect to see
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  COMPLEX)     return COMPLEX;
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL)    return RATIONAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
whereby the  programmer can multiply rational or complex numbers using
the familiar  mathematical notation.  The ability  to coin descriptive
names is  an important  part of  good programming, and it is therefore
desirable that  a programming  language give  the programmer  as  much
freedom as  possible in  the choice  of names.  Moreover, the  use  of
familiar notation in new contexts is a very powerful descriptive tool:
it is  an example  of the  principle of analogy. The ability of an Ada
programmer to  overload operators  upon new types allows the principle
of analogy  to be  used  in  programming.  Further  examples  of  this
principle are:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  VECTOR)            return SCALAR;
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  MATRIX)            return MATRIX;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In practice,  it is  unlikely that  two quite  different overloadings,
such as  the two  declarations of "&#42;" above, will be defined together.
It is  more likely  that each  will be defined in its own package - in
this case, one package might be called VECTOR_OPERATIONS and the other
SCALAR_OPERATIONS. Similarly,  rational multiplication  might well  be
defined in a package
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package RATIONAL_ARITHMETIC is

  type RATIONAL is private;

  function "+"   (RIGHT :  RATIONAL) return RATIONAL;
  function "-"   (RIGHT :  RATIONAL) return RATIONAL;

  function "+"                     (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;
  function "-"                     (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;
  function "&#42;"                     (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;
  function "/"                     (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;

  function "&#42;&#42;"                    (LEFT :  RATIONAL;  RIGHT : INTEGER) return RATIONAL;

  function "/"   (LEFT :  INTEGER;  RIGHT :  POSITIVE) return RATIONAL;
  ...
private

  type RATIONAL is
    record
      NUMERATOR    :  INTEGER;
      DENOMINATOR  :  POSITIVE;
    end record;

end RATIONAL_ARITHMETIC;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In this package, a new type is defined, together with the complete set
of applicable  operations. The programmer defining the type is free to
use the  traditional operator  symbols for  the new  type, and to give
them a  meaning analogous  to their meaning with other types. There is
no need  to worry about other meanings (declarations) that might occur
in other  packages defining  other types: the Ada overloading facility
permits  the   package  RATIONAL_ARITHMETIC   to  be   defined  as  an
independent software component.
<p>
These operations could be used thus:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
CM_PER_INCH :  constant RATIONAL  :=  254/100;  -- by international decree!
function INCH_TO_CM(INCHES :  RATIONAL) return RATIONAL is
begin
  return INCHES &#42; CM_PER_INCH;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that,  by an  analysis similar to the one given in <a href="ratl-09-02.html#9.2.2">section 9.2.2</a>,
we can identify the "/" operation in the expression "254/100" as being
the function that takes two integers and yields a rational result.

<H3><BR><a name="11.4.2">11.4.2 Overloading of Names</a></H3>

Several languages  beside Ada,  such  as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol  68</a>,  permit  operator
symbols to be overloaded. Ada however also permits subprogram names to
be overloaded, for exactly the same reasons. Consider for example
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure PUT(X :  in STRING);
procedure PUT(X :  in INTEGER);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This allows a programmer to write
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
PUT("The value of X is:  ");
PUT(X);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The abstract  operation PUT  applies indifferently to both strings and
integers; it  is therefore  appropriate that  the same name be used in
both cases.  Observe that  this is  in accord  with the conventions of
natural language:
<p>
<PRE>    "Put the book on the shelf"</PRE>
<p>
<PRE>    "Put the cat out"</PRE>
<p>
which does not have separate words for putting books and putting cats.
<p>
Ada does  not permit  the overloading  of variables or constants. This
again is in accordance with traditional habits of thought: we seem far
more willing to accept potentially ambiguous names for operations than
for things. Thus, mathematicians typically write
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
I1  +  I2       -- integers
X1  +  X2       -- floating-point values
V1  +  V2       -- vectors
M1  +  M2       -- matrices
Z1  +  Z2       -- complex numbers
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
where all  the addition  operations are  written "+" but their operand
types are distinguished by a systematic nomenclature. It seems to be a
convention of  our language  that verbs  are  generic  but  nouns  are
specific; Ada  reflects this by permitting operations to be overloaded
but - normally - not operands. Thus, Ada allows (and we find normal)
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SERVE(S :  SOUP);
procedure SERVE(F :  FRUIT);        -- permitted overloading
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
but does not allow (and which we would find abnormal)
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
OF_THE_DAY :  SOUP;
OF_THE_DAY :  FRUIT;              -- not a legal overloading!
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="11.4.3">11.4.3 Overloading of Literals</a></H3>

Literals stand  for values.  However, in a strongly-typed language, it
must be  possible to associate a type with every value, and so in some
sense a  literal should imply a type. This creates difficulties in two
cases: first, when different values, of different types, by chance are
represented  by   the  same  literal;  and  secondly,  when  the  same
conceptual value belongs to more than one type.
<p>
<H4>Enumeration Literals</H4>
<p>
The first case is called homography: two conceptually different values
have the same symbol. It may be illustrated by
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package PALETTE is
  type COLOR is (RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN,  ... );
  procedure PUT(X :  COLOR);
  ...
end;

package BOTANY is
  type FRUIT is (APPLE, ORANGE, BANANA, KIWI,  ... );
  procedure PUT(X º  FRUIT);
  ...
end;

package ORNIT&#187;OLOGY is
  type APTERON is (MOA, KIWI, OSTRICH,  ... );
  procedure PUT(X :  APTERON);
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In no  sense is a KIWI fruit the same as the flightless KIWI bird: the
homography is an accident of language.
<p>
A programming  language should not forbid such homography: it would be
unreasonable to  force the author of PALETTE to change the word ORANGE
merely because  it was  a  fruit;  and  indeed  Ada  never  forbids  a
programmer from  defining a  locally unambiguous  name. But  it  is  a
separate design decision whether to permit overloading of such names.
<p>
Ada permits  overloading of  enumeration literals;  this is  in accord
with the  idea that  an enumeration  literal resembles a parameterless
function. Hence the following is legal:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with   BOTANY,  ORNITHOLOGY;
use BOTANY,  ORNITHOLOGY;
procedure P is
  FRUIT_OF_THE_DAY   :  FRUIT  :=  KIWI;
  BIRD_IN_THE_HAND   :  APTERON :=  KIWI;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Resolution is  exactly as  for parameterless  functions: in  the above
declarations the required type is evident from the context.
<p>
This rule  also permits character literals to be used in more than one
type:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type ASCII is ( ... ,  'A',  'B',  'C',  ... );
type EBCDIC is ( ... ,  'A',  'B',  'C',  ... );

AC  :  ASCII :=  'A';
EC  :  EBCDIC    :=  'B';
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<H4>Numeric Literals</H4>
<p>
The numeric  literals, however,  illustrate the  second case.  In  the
following:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X  :  FLOAT     :=  1.0;
Y  :  LONG_FLOAT :=  1.0;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
the two occurrences of "1.0" stand for the same abstract value - unity
- but  in two  different physical  representations, and hence, in Ada,
associated with  two different  types. It  would be  possible to  view
"1.0" as  an overloaded  literal -  overloaded on  all real types. Ada
however takes  a different  view, that  we  believe  corresponds  more
closely to our intuition. It regards real literals as being all of one
type, the  type universal_real,  and introduces an implicit conversion
to the  required numeric  type. The  declarations above  are therefore
interpreted as
<p>   
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X  :  FLOAT     :=  FLOAT(1.0);
Y  :  LONG_FLOAT :=  LONG_FLOAT(1.0);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The alternative  view -  that the  literals should be considered to be
overloaded on  all numeric  types -  would lead  to some anomalies, of
which the most annoying would perhaps be that
<p>
<PRE>    if 1 &lt; 2 then  ...</PRE>
<p>
would be ambiguous: would we mean to invoke the "&lt;" of type INTEGER or
that of type LONG_INTEGER? The Ada view avoids such difficulties.
<p>
Observe by contrast that, if ASCII and EBCDIC are both visible, then
<p>
<PRE>    if 'A' &lt; '0' then  ...</PRE>
<p>
will indeed  be rejected  as ambiguous,  and  rightly  so,  since  the
relation means different things in ASCII and EBCDIC.
