<P>
The meaning of the occurrence of an identifier at a given place in the text
is defined by the visibility rules and also,  in  the  case  of  overloaded
declarations, by the overloading rules.  The identifiers considered in this
chapter  include  any  identifier  other than a reserved word, an attribute
designator, a pragma identifier, the identifier of a pragma argument, or an
identifier given as a pragma  argument.   The  places  considered  in  this
chapter  are  those where a lexical element (such as an identifier) occurs.
The overloaded declarations  considered  in  this  chapter  are  those  for
subprograms, enumeration literals, and single entries. 
<P>
For  each  identifier  and  at each place in the text, the visibility rules
determine a set of declarations (with this identifier) that define possible
meanings of an occurrence of the identifier.  A declaration is said  to  be
visible  at  a  given  place  in the text when, according to the visibility
rules, the declaration defines a possible meaning of this occurrence.   Two
cases arise.   
<ul>
<li>The visibility rules determine at most one possible meaning.  In  such
a   case   the  visibility  rules  are  sufficient  to  determine  the
declaration defining the meaning of the occurrence of the  identifier,
or  in  the  absence  of  such  a  declaration,  to determine that the
occurrence is not legal at the given point.<br><br> 
<li>The visibility rules determine more than  one  possible  meaning.   In
such a case the occurrence of the identifier is legal at this point if
and  only  if  exactly  one  visible declaration is acceptable for the
overloading rules in the given context (see section <a href="lrm-06-06.html#6.6">6.6</a> for the  rules
of  overloading  and  section  <a href="lrm-08-07.html#8.7">8.7</a>  for  the context used for overload
resolution).                                                                
</ul>
<P>
A declaration is only visible within a certain part  of  its  scope;   this
part   starts   at   the  end  of  the  declaration  except  in  a  package
specification, in which case it starts at the reserved word is given  after
the  identifier  of  the  package  specification.   (This  rule applies, in
particular, for implicit declarations.) 
<P>
Visibility is either by selection or direct.  A declaration is  visible  by
selection at places that are defined as follows. 
<ol>
<li>For a declaration given in the visible part of a package  declaration:
at  the  place of the selector after the dot of an expanded name whose
prefix denotes the package.<br><br> 
<li>For an entry declaration of a given task type:  at the  place  of  the
selector  after  the  dot  of  a  selected  component  whose prefix is
appropriate for the task type.<br><br>
<li>For a component declaration of a given record  type  declaration:   at
the  place of the selector after the dot of a selected component whose
prefix is appropriate for the type;  also at the place of a  component
simple  name  (before  the compound delimiter =&gt;) in a named component
association of an aggregate of the type.<br><br> 
<li>For a discriminant specification of a given type declaration:  at  the
same  places  as  for a component declaration;  also at the place of a
discriminant simple name (before the compound delimiter =&gt;) in a named
discriminant association of a discriminant constraint for the type.<br><br> 
<li>For a parameter specification of a given subprogram  specification  or
entry  declaration:   at the place of the formal parameter (before the
compound  delimiter  =&gt;)  in  a  named  parameter  association  of   a
corresponding subprogram or entry call.<br><br> 
<li>For a generic parameter declaration of a given generic unit:   at  the
place  of  the generic formal parameter (before the compound delimiter
=&gt;)  in  a  named  generic  association  of  a  corresponding  generic
instantiation. 
</ol>
Finally,  within  the  declarative region associated with a construct other
than a record type declaration, any  declaration  that  occurs  immediately
within  the  region  is  visible  by selection at the place of the selector
after the dot of an expanded name whose prefix denotes the construct. 
<P>
Where it is not visible by selection, a visible declaration is said  to  be
directly  visible.  A declaration is directly visible within a certain part
of its immediate scope;  this part extends to  the  end  of  the  immediate
scope  of  the  declaration,  but  excludes places where the declaration is
hidden  as  explained  below.   In  addition,   a   declaration   occurring
immediately  within  the  visible  part  of  a package can be made directly 
visible by means of a use  clause  according  to  the  rules  described  in
section  <a href="lrm-08-04.html#8.4">8.4</a>.   (See also section <a href="lrm-08-06.html#8.6">8.6</a> for the visibility of library units.) 
<P>
A declaration is said to be hidden within (part of)  an  inner  declarative
region  if  the inner region contains a homograph of this declaration;  the
outer declaration is then hidden within the immediate scope  of  the  inner  
homograph.  Each of two declarations is said to be a homograph of the other
if  both  declarations  have the same identifier and overloading is allowed
for  at  most  one  of  the  two.   If  overloading  is  allowed  for  both
declarations, then each of the two is a homograph of the other if they have
the  same identifier, operator symbol, or character literal, as well as the
same parameter and result type profile (see <a href="lrm-06-06.html#6.6">6.6</a>). 
<P>
Within the specification of a subprogram, every declaration with  the  same
designator  as  the  subprogram is hidden;  the same holds within a generic
instantiation that declares a subprogram, and within an  entry  declaration
or  the formal part of an accept statement;  where hidden in this manner, a
declaration is visible neither by selection  nor directly.                                             
<P>
Two declarations that occur immediately within the same declarative  region
must not be homographs, unless either or both of the following requirements
are  met:   (a)  exactly  one  of  them  is  the  implicit declaration of a
predefined operation;  (b) exactly one of them is the implicit  declaration
of  a  derived subprogram.  In such cases, a predefined operation is always
hidden by the other homograph;  a derived  subprogram  hides  a  predefined 
operation,  but  is  hidden  by  any other homograph.  Where hidden in this
manner, an implicit declaration is hidden within the entire  scope  of  the
other  declaration  (regardless  of  which  declaration occurs first);  the
implicit declaration is visible neither by selection nor directly. 
<P>
Whenever a declaration with a certain identifier is visible  from  a  given
point,  the identifier and the declared entity (if any) are also said to be
visible from that point.  Direct visibility and visibility by selection are
likewise defined for character literals and operator symbols.  An  operator
is  directly  visible if and only if the corresponding operator declaration
is directly  visible.   Finally,  the  notation  associated  with  a  basic
operation is directly visible within the entire scope of this operation. 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    procedure P is
       A, B : BOOLEAN; 

       procedure Q is
          C : BOOLEAN;
          B : BOOLEAN;  --  an inner homograph of B
       begin
          ...
          B := A;    --  means Q.B := P.A;
          C := P.B;  --  means Q.C := P.B;
       end;
    begin
       ...
       A := B;  --  means P.A := P.B;
    end; 
</pre>
<P>
Note on the visibility of library units: 
<P>
The  visibility of library units is determined by with clauses (see <a href="lrm-10-01.html#10.1.1">10.1.1</a>)
and by the fact that library units are implicitly declared in  the  package
STANDARD (see <a href="lrm-08-06.html#8.6">8.6</a>). 
<P>
Note on homographs: 
<P>
The  same  identifier  may  occur in different declarations and may thus be
associated  with  different  entities,  even  if  the   scopes   of   these
declarations  overlap.  Overlap of the scopes of declarations with the same
identifier can result from overloading of subprograms  and  of  enumeration
literals.   Such  overlaps  can also occur for entities declared in package
visible parts and for entries, record  components,  and  parameters,  where   
there  is overlap of the scopes of the enclosing package declarations, task
declarations, record type declarations, subprogram  declarations,  renaming
declarations,  or  generic  declarations.   Finally  overlapping scopes can
result from nesting.  
<P>
Note on immediate scope, hiding, and visibility: 
<P>
The rules defining immediate scope, hiding, and  visibility  imply  that  a
reference  to  an  identifier within its own declaration is illegal (except
for packages and generic packages).  The identifier hides outer  homographs
within  its  immediate  scope, that is,  from the start of the declaration;
on the other hand, the identifier is visible only  after  the  end  of  the
declaration.    For  this  reason,  all  but  the  last  of  the  following
declarations are illegal:                                                              
<pre>
    K : INTEGER := K * K;              --  illegal
    T : T;                             --  illegal
    procedure P(X : P);                --  illegal
    procedure Q(X : REAL := Q);        --  illegal, even if there is a
                                           function named Q
    procedure R(R : REAL);   --  an inner declaration is legal (although
                                 confusing)
</pre>
