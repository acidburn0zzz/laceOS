The guidelines in this document are not intended to stand alone as a standard. 
It is not even clear in some cases that a guideline could be enforced since it 
is only intended to make the engineer aware of tradeoffs.  In other cases, a 
choice still remains about a guideline, such as how many spaces to use for 
each level of indentation.
<P>
When a guideline is too general to show an example, the &quot;instantiation&quot; 
section of each guideline contains more specific guidelines.  These can be 
considered for a standard and are more likely to be enforceable.  Any 
organization that attempts to extract standards from this document needs to 
evaluate the complete context.  Each guideline works best when related 
guideines are practiced.  In isolation, a guideline may have little or no 
benefit.
