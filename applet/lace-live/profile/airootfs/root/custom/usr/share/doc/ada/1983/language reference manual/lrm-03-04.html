<P>
A derived type definition defines a new (base) type  whose  characteristics
are  derived from those of a parent type;  the new type is called a derived
type.  A derived type definition further defines a derived  subtype,  which
is a subtype of the derived type. 
<pre>
    derived_type_definition ::= new subtype_indication 
</pre>
<P>
The  subtype indication that occurs after the reserved word new defines the
parent subtype.  The parent type is the base type of  the  parent  subtype.
If  a constraint exists for the parent subtype, a similar constraint exists
for the  derived  subtype;   the  only  difference  is  that  for  a  range
constraint,  and  likewise  for  a  floating or fixed point constraint that
includes a range constraint, the value of each bound  is  replaced  by  the
corresponding  value  of  the  derived  type.   The  characteristics of the
derived type are defined as follows: 
<ul>
<li>The derived type belongs to the same class  of  types  as  the  parent
type.   The  set  of possible values for the derived type is a copy of
the set of possible values for the parent type.  If the parent type is
composite, then the same components exist for the  derived  type,  and
the subtype of corresponding components is the same.<br><br> 
<li>For each basic operation of the parent type, there is a  corresponding
basic  operation  of  the derived type.  Explicit type conversion of a
value of the parent type into the corresponding value of  the  derived  
type is allowed and vice versa as explained in <a href="lrm-04-06.html#4.6">section 4.6</a>.<br><br> 
<li>For each enumeration literal or predefined operator of the parent type
there is a corresponding operation for the derived type.<br><br> 
<li>If the parent type is a task type, then for each entry of  the  parent 
type there is a corresponding entry for the derived type.<br><br> 
<li>If a default expression exists for a component of an object having the
parent  type,  then  the  same  default  expression  is  used  for the
corresponding component of an object having the derived type.<br><br>                                              
<li>If the parent type is an access type, then the parent and the  derived
type  share the same collection;  there is a null access value for the
derived type and it is the default initial value of that type.<br><br> 
<li>If an explicit representation clause exists for the parent type and if
this clause appears before the derived type definition, then there  is
a  corresponding  representation  clause  (an  implicit  one)  for the
derived type.<br><br> 
<li>Certain subprograms that are operations of the parent type are said to
be derivable.  For each derivable subprogram of the parent type, there
is a corresponding derived subprogram for the derived type.  Two kinds
of derivable subprograms exist.  First, if the parent type is declared
immediately within the visible part of a package,  then  a  subprogram
that is itself explicitly declared immediately within the visible part
becomes  derivable  after  the  end  of  the visible part, if it is an
operation of the parent type. (The  explicit  declaration  is  by  a
subprogram   declaration, a renaming  declaration,  or  a  generic
instantiation.)  Second, if the parent type is itself a derived  type,
then  any  subprogram  that  has  been  derived by this parent type is
further derivable, unless the parent type is declared in  the  visible  
part  of a package and the derived subprogram is hidden by a derivable
subprogram of the first kind. 
</ul>
<P>
Each operation of the derived type is implicitly declared at the  place  of
the  derived  type  declaration.   The implicit declarations of any derived
subprograms occur last. 
<P>
The specification  of  a  derived  subprogram  is  obtained  implicitly  by
systematic  replacement  of  the  parent  type  by  the derived type in the
specification of the derivable subprogram.  Any subtype of the parent  type
is  likewise  replaced  by  a  subtype  of  the derived type with a similar
constraint (as for the transformation of a constraint of the parent subtype
into the corresponding constraint of the derived  subtype).   Finally,  any
expression  of  the  parent  type  is  made  to  be  the  operand of a type
conversion that yields a result of the derived type. 
<P>
Calling a derived subprogram is equivalent  to  calling  the  corresponding
subprogram  of  the  parent type, in which each actual parameter that is of
the derived type is replaced by a type conversion of this actual  parameter
to the parent type (this means that a conversion to the parent type happens
before  the  call for the modes in and in out;  a reverse conversion to the
derived type happens after the call for the  modes  in  out  and  out,  see
<a href="lrm-06-04.html#6.4.1">6.4.1</a>).   In  addition, if the result of a called function is of the parent
type, this result is converted to the derived type. 
<P>
If a derived or private type is declared  immediately  within  the  visible
part  of  a  package, then, within this visible part, this type must not be
used as the parent type of a derived type definition.  (For private  types,
see also <a href="lrm-07-04.html#7.4.1">section 7.4.1</a>.) 
<P>
For the elaboration of a derived type definition, the subtype indication is
first  elaborated,  the  derived  type  is  then  created, and finally, the
derived subtype is created.      
<P>
Examples: 
<pre>
    type LOCAL_COORDINATE is new COORDINATE;   --  two different types
    type MIDWEEK is new DAY range TUE .. THU;  --  see <a href="lrm-03-05.html#3.5.1">3.5.1</a>
    type COUNTER is new POSITIVE;              --  same range as POSITIVE 

    type SPECIAL_KEY is new KEY_MANAGER.KEY;   --  see <a href="lrm-07-04.html#7.4.2">7.4.2</a>
    -- the derived subprograms have the following specifications: 

    -- procedure GET_KEY(K : out SPECIAL_KEY);
    -- function "&lt;"(X,Y : SPECIAL_KEY) return BOOLEAN;                                              
</pre>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The rules of derivation of basic operations and enumeration literals  imply
that  the  notation for any literal or aggregate of the derived type is the
same as for the parent type;  such literals and aggregates are said  to  be
overloaded.   Similarly,  it  follows  that  the  notation  for  denoting a
component, a discriminant, an entry, a slice, or an attribute is  the  same
for the derived type as for the parent type. 
<P>
Hiding  of a derived subprogram is allowed even within the same declarative
region (see <a href="lrm-08-03.html#8.3">8.3</a>).  A derived subprogram hides a  predefined  operator  that
has the same parameter and result type profile (see <a href="lrm-06-06.html#6.6">6.6</a>). 
<P>
A  generic  subprogram  declaration  is  not  derivable since it declares a
generic unit rather than a subprogram.  On the other hand, an instantiation
of a generic subprogram is a (nongeneric) subprogram, which is derivable if
it satisfies the requirements for derivability of subprograms. 
<P>
If the parent type is a boolean type, the predefined  relational  operators
of  the  derived  type deliver a result of the predefined type BOOLEAN (see
<a href="lrm-04-05.html#4.5.2">4.5.2</a>).    
<P>
If a representation clause is given for the parent type but  appears  after
the  derived  type declaration, then no corresponding representation clause
applies to the derived type;  hence an explicit representation  clause  for
such a derived type is allowed. 
<P>
For  a  derived subprogram, if a parameter belongs to the derived type, the
subtype of this parameter need not  have  any  value  in  common  with  the
derived subtype.
