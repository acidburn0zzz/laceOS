<H2>CHAPTER 6: Access Types</H2>

<H3><a name="6.2">6.2 Overview of the Issues</a></H3>

The main  problems usually encountered with access types fall into two
categories:
<ul>
<li>Conceptual aspects
<p>
<li>Reliability, efficiency, and implementation.
</ul>

We first  discuss these  problems and  then define the desirable goals
for a formulation of access types.

<H3><BR><a name="6.2.1">6.2.1 Conceptual Aspects</a></H3>

The objects of a program can be classified into two categories: static
objects and dynamically allocated objects.
<p>
<b>Static objects</b>  are declared  in a  program  and  are  containers  for
values. Each  static object  has a  simple name that is used to denote
either the  container or the value, depending on the context where the
name appears.  The simple  name of  a static  object is defined by its
declaration. For  example, an  object declared  within a  procedure is
created by  the elaboration of the object declaration and exists until
the end  of the  procedure. Such  objects are  said to be static since
their lifetime  is determined by the static (textual) structure of the
program.
<p>
In contrast,  the creation  of <b>dynamically  allocated  objects</b>  occurs
dynamically, by  the execution  of so-called  allocators, and  is  not
directly related  to the  program structure. In general, the number of
dynamically allocated  objects is  not easy to predict and it will not
be possible  to define  their names  by declarations.  Hence  what  is
returned by the execution of an allocator is an internal name - not an
identifier - and therefore it cannot be used explicitly in the text to
denote the newly allocated object.
<p>
To deal with this problem, one usually defines by declaration a number
of indirect names that may be used to access the different dynamically
allocated objects  at successive  stages of  execution.  The  internal
names of  the allocated  objects will  be the values of these declared
indirect names.  For this  reason, indirect  names are  called  access
objects in Ada and throughout the remainder of this chapter (they have
been called  pointers or  reference variables  in other languages). An
access object  can be a declared variable or a component of a declared
variable (and  hence static);  but it  can also be a component of some
dynamically created object. Internal names are called access values in
Ada. To  emphasize the difference between names and internal names, we
say that  a name denotes an object whereas we say that an access value
designates an object.
<p>
Four important  consequences follow  from the fact that access objects
contain internal names:
<ol type=a>
<li>The same  internal name  may be  contained in several
   access objects,  with the  consequence that  they provide access to
   the same dynamically allocated object.
<p>
<li>Access objects  may be used to describe relations, in
   particular, relations that change over time.
<p>
<li>Since  the  internal  name  contained  in  an  access
   variable may  vary with successive stages of the program execution,
   a given  dynamically allocated  object may  become inaccessible:  A
   dynamically allocated  object is accessible as long as its internal
   name is  contained by  a declared access object, or if its internal
   name is contained by an access object that is itself a component of
   a dynamically allocated object that is still accessible, and so on.
<p>
<li>Since an  access object does not contain any internal
   name prior  to its  first allocation or assignment, there must be a
   special null  value corresponding  to no  internal name  ( none  in
   Simula, nil  in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 68</a> and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lisp</a>, null in Ada). This value is also
   required for describing partial relations.
</ol>

Sharing and  the possibility  of inaccessibility  are thus  two of the
classical difficulties  of access  types. A third classical difficulty
is the well-known problem of dereferencing: Considering the name of an
access object, this name may stand for several different things:
<ul>
<li>The name of the (static) access object.
<p>
<li>The content  of the  access object (that is, its value: an internal
   name).
<p>
<li>The content  of the dynamically allocated object that is designated
   by this internal name.
</ul>>

The first  two possibilities  (name or  content) also exist for static
objects. Most  languages (<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Bliss</a>  being an  exception)  have  the  same
notation in  the two  cases, and  make a  distinction by  context. The
third possibility,  however, only  exists for  access objects, and the
solutions offered by programming languages are very diverse.
<p>
Two issues arise:
<ul>
<li>For assignments,  it must be clear whether the assignment refers to
   the access  objects (access  assignment),  or  to  the  dynamically
   allocated  objects   they  designate   (value   assignment).   This
   distinction is  essential and  has been treated differently in most
   languages.
<p>
<li>For component  selection, that  is, for  denoting a  component of a
   dynamically  created   record,  there  is  no  possible  ambiguity.
   Nevertheless some  languages  have  chosen  to  make  dereferencing
   explicit even in this case.
</ul>

The diversity of the solutions adopted by several languages is a clear
indication of the conceptual difficulties involved. We illustrate this
diversity with  the example  below, where X and Y are access variables
and AGE is a component of the dynamically allocated record object (For
the Algol  68 formulation,  T is  assumed to be the mode of the record
values; the  Simula example  extends  the  possibilities  offered  for
texts).
<p>
<p>

X.all := Y.all;</pre></td></tr></table>
</td><td>
<table><tr><td>
<pre>X.AGE
X.AGE
X^.AGE
X.AGE</pre></td></tr></table></tr></table></center>
<p>

A final  conceptual difficulty  in defining access types is the notion
of constant access objects. Suppose an access object is declared to be
constant. Several  alternative interpretations could be given for such
a declaration.
<ol>
<li>The access value (an internal name) is constant. This
   means that  it always  designates the  same  dynamically  allocated
   object. The value of the latter, however, could vary.
<p>
<li>The access value can vary, but it may only be used to
   read the components of a designated object.
<p>
<li>The access  value is constant and it may only be used
   to read  the components  of the  designated object.  Note, however,
   that  we   cannot  infer  that  the  dynamically  allocated  object
   designated by  such a  constant is  itself  constant,  since  other
   variables may designate the same dynamically allocated object.
</ol>

Some languages,  including  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Mary</a>  and  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis</a>,  have  provided  different
syntaxes for all three forms of constant semantics. The first meaning,
however, is  the one  that is  most consistent  with what  is done for
other types. Consider the analogy with an index:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
subtype INDEX is INTEGER range 1 .. 9;
MEDIAN  :  constant INDEX  :=  (INDEX'FIRST + INDEX'LAST)/2;
TABLE   :  array (INDEX) of COLOR  :=  (others =&gt; WHITE);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In this  formulation we  use the  index MEDIAN  to refer to the median
value of  the table:  TABLE(MEDIAN). Now,  the  fact  that  MEDIAN  is
constant only  means that  we always  refer to this component; it does
not mean that assignment to this component is forbidden.

<H3><BR><a name="6.2.2">6.2.2 Reliability, Efficiency, and Implementation Issues</a></H3>

When  a   dynamically  allocated   object  becomes  inaccessible,  the
corresponding space  may (at  least theoretically)  be  reclaimed  for
other uses  without  any  risk.  This  operation,  classically  called
garbage-collection, has  been used  in languages such as <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lisp, Simula,
and Algol 68</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, there  is no  method  of  garbage  collection  that  is
generally suitable  to real-time applications. The method used in most
Lisp implementations  is to  allocate storage  continuously until  the
available space is exhausted, and then reclaim inaccessible objects by
a complete  traversal of  all allocated  structures. This implies that
the  execution   of  an   allocator  can   suddenly  initiate  garbage
collection,  thereby  causing  a  large  and  unpredictable  overhead.
Moreover, as  the available storage becomes increasingly fragmented by
accessible objects,  garbage collection  could be  triggered ever more
frequently, causing rapid degradation of performance.
<p>
Another method  is to  maintain reference  counts with  each allocated
object: an object is inaccessible if its reference count is zero. This
fails with  cyclic structures,  where a  non-zero reference count does
not necessarily  imply accessibility.  It also  causes  implementation
problems, since  the reference  count of  an accessed  object must  be
decremented whenever  a declared  access  object  that  designates  it
passes out of scope - either in the normal course of execution or as a
result of  an exception.  Access objects are therefore associated with
finalization actions,  with all their attendant difficulties. However,
even if  this method  were fully  implemented it  would not  solve the
problem: the unpredictable overhead has merely been transferred to the
deallocation operation.
<p>
A third  method is  to perform  garbage collection  periodically by  a
parallel process  of  lower  priority.  Provided  the  synchronization
problems  can  be  solved,  this  provides  the  least  unsatisfactory
solution for real-time use. Its major defect is that, under conditions
where the  transaction rate  is high, the lower-priority processes may
become starved,  so garbage  collection might not be done often enough
to maintain a satisfactory pool of free storage.
<p>
For these  reasons several  languages in  the systems programming area
(including <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis  and Euclid</a>) try to achieve better control over storage
management for  dynamically allocated  objects. This  means that  such
languages offer  the opportunity  to define  the  workings  of  object
allocation  within  the  language  itself.  Similarly  they  admit  an
explicit deallocation  statement which  can also be defined within the
language itself.
<p>
Such operations  usually cannot  be written  with the  full degree  of
compilation-time checking  that is  provided by  types, though the Ada
generics facility  permits a greater degree of safety than is found in
many other  languages.  In  addition,  the  availability  of  explicit
deallocation introduces the possibility of dangling access values: the
program might  deallocate a dynamically allocated object that is still
accessible by other paths - its internal name still being contained by
other access variables.
<p>
Confronted with  this dilemma  between reliability  and efficiency,  a
possible answer  is to  choose reliability  and accept the possibility
that access  types might  not be  used  in  programs  that  are  time-
critical. However,  there are cases where access types should be used,
precisely because  the application  considered  is  time-critical.  We
illustrate this point with the following example:
<p>
Assume that  we need  to compute the sum of the elements of a circular
list. A formulation using an array might look as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type INDEX is range 1 .. 1000;

type ITEM is
  record
    SUCC, PRED :  INDEX;
    CONTENT    :  INTEGER;
  end record;

TABLE :  array (INDEX) of ITEM;
HEAD, NEXT :  INDEX;
SUM :  INTEGER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The algorithm for adding the contents of the successors of HEAD may be
written as a while loop:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SUM    :=  0;
NEXT   :=  TABLE(HEAD).SUCC;
while NEXT /=  HEAD loop
  SUM   :=  SUM + TABLE(NEXT).CONTENT;
  NEXT  :=  TABLE(NEXT).SUCC;
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Clearly, the  above formulation  attempts to use index values in order
to express  relations, and  does  not  achieve  this  with  quite  the
elegance and  readability offered by access variables. The main point,
however, is that the index computation involved in accessing the array
element TABLE(NEXT) at each iteration may be a drawback, especially on
small computers where multiplication is rather slow.
<p>
The alternative formulation with access objects (declarations omitted)
is given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SUM   :=  0;
NEXT  :=  HEAD.SUCC;
while NEXT /=  HEAD loop
  SUM   :=  SUM + NEXT.CONTENT;
  NEXT  :=  NEXT.SUCC;
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This solution  is more readable - it does not require mention of names
such as  TABLE that are irrelevant to the logic of the algorithm - and
also more efficient since no index calculation is involved.
<p>
In general,  when access variables are used, address computations will
be done  only once,  at the  time of  dynamic  allocation.  Thereafter
access values can only be assigned to access objects or used to access
the dynamically  allocated objects.  This  however  does  not  involve
address computations.  On the  other  hand,  when  indices  are  used,
address computations must be redone for every access.

<H3><BR><a name="6.2.3">6.2.3 Goals For a Formulation of Access Types</a></H3>

As shown  by the  previous example,  one of  the advantages  of access
variables is  efficiency. As a consequence we must be able to use them
in time-critical  applications. In this case, however, we must provide
a form  of access  variable that does not result in garbage collection
with the  associated costs  and unpredictability.  Naturally this does
not exclude  the possibility  of  more  elaborate  storage  management
strategies in applications that are not time-critical.
<p>
The  needs  of  efficiency  being  thus  satisfied,  it  remains  that
reliability should be a major goal in the formulation of access types,
especially in  view of the conceptual difficulties they raise. Hence a
safe  formulation  of  access  types  should  have  several  important
properties:
     
<ul>
<li>There  must  be  a  null  value  for  access  objects.  Since  null
   designates no  object, any  attempt to  denote a  component of this
   nonexistent object should raise the exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR (the
   null value  cannot be dereferenced). On many computers checking for
   such attempts  is achievable  without  any  run-time  cost  if  the
   internal value of null corresponds to some protected address.
<p>
<li>Access variables  should be  typed (as in Simula or Pascal) so that
   one access variable can designate only objects of one type.
<p>
<li>There  should   be  a  basic  operation  -  the  allocator  -  that
   dynamically  creates   an  object  and  delivers  an  access  value
   designating this  object (its  internal name).  On the  other hand,
   there should  be  no  operation  for  explicit  deallocation  of  a
   dynamically allocated object (to avoid dangling access values).
<p>
<li>There should  be a clear distinction between access types and other
   types. In  particular, there should be no possibility for an access
   value to  designate a  static variable  (again, to  avoid  dangling
   access values).
</ul>
