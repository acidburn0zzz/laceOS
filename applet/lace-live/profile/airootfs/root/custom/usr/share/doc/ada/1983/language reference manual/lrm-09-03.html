<H2><A NAME="9.3">9.3</A>.  Task Execution - Task Activation  </H2>
<A HREF="lrm-09-02.html#9.2"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="lrm-09.html#9"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="lrm-09-04.html#9.4"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
A  task body defines the execution of any task that is designated by a task
object of the corresponding task type.  The initial part of this  execution
is  called  the  activation  of  the  task  object,  and  also  that of the
designated task;  it consists of the elaboration of the  declarative  part,
if  any, of the task body.  The execution of different tasks, in particular
their activation, proceeds in parallel. 
<P>
If an object declaration that declares a  task  object  occurs  immediately
within  a  declarative  part, then the activation of the task object starts
after the elaboration of the declarative part (that is, after  passing  the
reserved  word  begin following the declarative part);  similarly if such a
declaration  occurs  immediately  within  a  package   specification,   the
activation  starts  after  the  elaboration  of the declarative part of the
package body.  The same holds for the activation of a task object that is a
subcomponent of an object declared immediately within a declarative part or
package specification.  The first statement following the declarative  part
is  executed only after conclusion of the activation of these task objects. 
<P>
Should an exception be raised by the activation of one of these tasks, that
task becomes a completed task (see <a href="lrm-09-04.html#9.4">9.4</a>);   other  tasks  are  not  directly 
affected.   Should  one  of  these  tasks  thus become completed during its
activation, the exception TASKING_ERROR is raised upon  conclusion  of  the
activation  of  all  of  these  tasks  (whether  successfully or not);  the
exception is raised at  a  place  that  is  immediately  before  the  first
statement  following  the  declarative part (immediately after the reserved
word begin).  Should several of these tasks thus  become  completed  during
their activation, the exception TASKING_ERROR is raised only once. 
<P>
Should  an  exception be raised by the elaboration of a declarative part or
package  specification,  then  any  task  that  is  created  (directly   or
indirectly)  by  this  elaboration  and  that  is not yet activated becomes
terminated and is therefore  never  activated  (see  section  <a href="lrm-09-04.html#9.4">9.4</a>  for  the
definition of a terminated task). 
<P>
For  the  above  rules,  in  any  package  body  without statements, a null
statement is assumed.  For any package without a package body, an  implicit
package  body  containing a single null statement is assumed.  If a package
without a package body is declared immediately within some program unit  or
block  statement,  the  implicit  package  body  occurs  at  the end of the
declarative part of the program unit or  block  statement;   if  there  are
several  such  packages,  the  order  of  the  implicit  package  bodies is
undefined. 
<P>
A task object that is the object, or a subcomponent of the object,  created
by  the  evaluation  of  an allocator is activated by this evaluation.  The
activation starts after any initialization for the object  created  by  the
allocator;   if  several subcomponents are task objects, they are activated
in parallel.  The access value designating such an object  is  returned  by
the allocator only after the conclusion of these activations. 
<P>
Should an exception be raised by the activation of one of these tasks, that 
task  becomes  a  completed  task;   other tasks are not directly affected.  
Should one of these tasks thus become completed during its activation,  the
exception  TASKING_ERROR is raised upon conclusion of the activation of all
of these tasks (whether successfully or not);  the exception is  raised  at
the  place where the allocator is evaluated.  Should several of these tasks
thus become completed during their activation, the exception  TASKING_ERROR
is raised only once. 
<P>
Should  an  exception be raised by the initialization of the object created
by an allocator (hence before  the  start  of  any  activation),  any  task
designated  by  a  subcomponent  of  this  object becomes terminated and is
therefore never activated.                                                        
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    procedure P is
       A, B : RESOURCE;  --  elaborate the task objects A, B
       C    : RESOURCE;  --  elaborate the task object C
    begin
       --  the tasks A, B, C are activated in parallel before the first statement
       ...
    end; 
</pre>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
An entry of a task can be called before the task has  been  activated.   If
several  tasks  are  activated  in  parallel, the execution of any of these
tasks need not await the end of the activation  of the other tasks.  A task
may become completed during its activation either because of  an  exception
or because it is aborted (see <a href="lrm-09-10.html#9.10">9.10</a>).
