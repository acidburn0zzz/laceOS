<h1>
11   Exceptions
</h1>

<p>
The changes to exception handling from Ada 83 are quite small.  The main
changes are
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The exception Numeric_Error is now a renaming of Constraint_Error
     and is also obsolescent.
<li>
    The notion of an exception occurrence is introduced.  This refers to
     an instance of raising an exception.  The package Ada.Exceptions
     contains procedures providing additional information regarding an
     exception occurrence.
<li>
    The interaction between exceptions and optimization is clarified.
<li>
    A minor improvement is that an accept statement may now directly
     have an exception handler.
</ul>

<h2>
<a name=1>
11.1  Numeric Error
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Those familiar with the early use of Ada 83 will recall that there was
considerable confusion between Numeric_Error and Constraint_Error in a
number of corner situations.  As a consequence the ARG ruled that
implementations should raise Constraint_Error in all situations for which
Numeric_Error was originally intended.  This was a non-binding
interpretation with the intention of making it binding in due course.
</p>
<p>
Essentially all implementations of Ada 83 now raise Constraint_Error
although for historic reasons some programs may contain dormant handlers
for Numeric_Error.
</p>
<p>
   The development of Ada 95 provided an opportunity to remove this
historic wart once and for all.  It was thus proposed that Numeric_Error
be completely removed.  However, many reviewers pointed out that those
programs which had conformed to the advice of AI-387 by consistently
writing
<pre>
   when Constraint_Error | Numeric_Error =>
</pre>
would then become illegal.  Accordingly, in Ada 95, Numeric_Error is
simply a renaming of Constraint_Error.  Such a change alone would still
have made the above illegal because, in Ada 83, all the exceptions in a
handler had to be distinct; a supplementary change is thus that an
exception may appear more than once in a handler in Ada 95.
</p>
<p>
   Allowing multiple instances of an exception in a given handler has
benefits in other areas.  It now allows sequences such as
<pre>
   when Text_IO.Data_Error | Integer_IO.Data_Error =>
</pre>
where there may be documentation advantages in revealing the potential
causes of the exception.
</p>
<p>
   Of course if the user had deliberately relied upon a distinction
between Numeric_Error and Constraint_Error then the program will now
become incorrect.  It may be simply incompatible but may also be
inconsistent if the handlers are in different frames.  For a more
detailed discussion see A-4.5.  Despite this possibility it was concluded
that the perhaps safer alternative of completely removing Numeric_Error
was not appropriate for this revision although it should be reconsidered
at the next revision.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=2>
11.2  Exception Occurrences
</a>
</h2>

<p>
It is important in many programs to be able to recover from all
exceptions and to continue processing in some way.  All exceptions
including unexpected exceptions can be caught by an others handler.
Unfortunately, however, Ada 83 provided no way of identifying the
particular exception and it was thus not possible to log the details or
take specific appropriate action.
</p>
<p>
   This is overcome in Ada 95 by the introduction of the concept of an
exception occurrence and a number of subprograms to access information
regarding the occurrence.  The type Exception_Occurrence and the
subprograms are declared in the package Ada.Exceptions.  The user can
then declare a choice parameter in a handler through which the particular
occurrence can be identified.  For example a fragment of a continuous
embedded system might take the form
<pre>
   with Ada.Exceptions;
   task body Control is
   ...
   begin
      loop
         begin
            ... -- main algorithm
         exception
            when Error: others =>
               -- unhandled exception; log it
               Log("Unknown error in task Control"
                     &
                     Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Information(Error));
               -- reset data structures as necessary
         end;
         -- loop around to restart the task
      end loop;
   end Control;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The choice parameter Error is a constant of the type
Exception_Occurrence.  The function Exception_Information returns a
printable string describing the exception and details of the cause of the
occurrence.  The actual details depend on the implementation.
</p>
<p>
   Two other functions in Ada.Exceptions are Exception_Name and
Exception_Message.  Exception_Name just returns the name of the exception
(the expanded name) and Exception_Message returns a one-liner giving
further details (it excludes the name).  Thus Exception_Name,
Exception_Message and Exception_Information provide a hierarchy of
strings appropriate to different requirements.
</p>
<p>
   The purpose of the three functions is to provide information suitable
for output and subsequent analysis in a standard way.  Although the
details of the strings will depend upon the implementation nevertheless
they should be appropriate for analysis on that system.
</p>
<p>
   Exception occurrences can be saved for later analysis by the two
subprograms Save_Occurrence.  Note that the type Exception_Occurrence is
limited; using subprograms rather than allowing the user to save values
through assignment gives better control over the use of storage for saved
exception occurrences (which could of course be large since they may
contain full trace back information).  The procedure Save_Occurrence may
truncate the message to 200 characters whereas the function
Save_Occurrence (which returns an access value) is not permitted to
truncate the message.  (Note that 200 corresponds to the minimum size of
line length required to be supported, see 2.2.)
</p>
<p>
   An occurrence may be reraised by calling the procedure
Reraise_Occurrence.  This is precisely equivalent to reraising an
exception by a raise statement without an exception name and does not
create a new occurrence (thus ensuring that the original cause is not
lost).  An advantage of Reraise_Occurrence is that it can be used to
reraise an occurrence that was stored by Save_Occurrence.
</p>
<p>
   It is possible to attach a specific message to the raising of an
exception by the procedure Raise_Exception.  The first parameter is a
value of the type Exception_Id which identifies the exception; this value
can be obtained by applying the attribute Identity to the identifier of
the exception.  The second parameter is the message (a string) which can
then be retrieved by calling Exception_Message.  This provides a
convenient means of identifying the cause of an exception during program
debugging.  Consider
<pre>
   declare
      O_Rats: exception;
   begin
   ...
      Raise_Exception(O_Rats'Identity, "Hard cheese");
   ...
      Raise_Exception(O_Rats'Identity, "Rat poison");
   ...
   exception
      when Event: O_Rats =>
         Put("O_Rats raised because of ");
         Put(Exception_Message(Event));
   end;
</pre>
Calling Raise_Exception raises the exception O_Rats with the string
attached as the message.  The second call of Put in the handler will
output Hard cheese or Rat poison according to which occurrence of O_Rats
was raised.  See also the example in 9.6.1.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the system messages do not include the name so user and
system messages can be processed in a similar manner without the user
having to insert the exception name in the message.
</p>

<h2>

11.3  Exceptions and Optimization
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The general objective is to strike a sensible balance between prescribing
the language so rigorously that no optimizations are possible (which
would make the language uncompetitive) and allowing so much freedom that
the language semantics are almost non-existent (which would impact on
portability and provability).  A progressive approach is required that
enables different degrees to be permitted in different circumstances.
</p>
<p>
   Much of the difficulty lies with exceptions and ensuring that they are
still raised in the appropriate frame.  In particular we have ensured
that calls to subprograms in other library units are not disrupted.
   For details of the approach taken the reader is referred to [RM95
11.6].  A more detailed discussion of the rationale will be found in
[AARM].
</p>

<h2>
<a name=4>
11.4  Other Improvements
</a>
</h2>

<p>
As mentioned in 1.3, the description of exception handling has been
simplified by the introduction of a new syntactic category
handled_sequence_of_statements which embraces a sequence of statements
plus associated exception handlers and is used for all situations where
handlers are allowed.
</p>
<p>
   An incidental minor improvement following from this change to the
syntax is that an accept statement can now have a handler without the
necessity for an inner block, thus
<pre>
   accept E do
      ...
      ...
   exception
      ...
   end E;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   A further practical improvement is that the concept of a current error
file is introduced.  This can conveniently be used to log error messages
without cluttering other output.  This is discussed in more detail in
Part Three.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=5>
11.5  Requirements Summary
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The specific requirement
<pre>
     R 4.5-A(1) - Accessing an Exception Name
</pre>
is met by the introduction of exception occurrences.
</p>
<p>
   The requirement
<pre>
     R2.2-C(1) - Minimize Special Case Restrictions
</pre>
mentions as an example the curious fact that an accept statement cannot
have an exception handler.  This has been rectified.
