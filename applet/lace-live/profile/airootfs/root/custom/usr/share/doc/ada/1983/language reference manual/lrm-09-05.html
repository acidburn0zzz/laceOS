<P>
Entry calls and accept statements are the primary means of  synchronization
of  tasks, and of communicating values between tasks.  An entry declaration
is similar to a subprogram declaration  and  is  only  allowed  in  a  task
specification.   The  actions  to  be performed when an entry is called are
specified by corresponding accept statements. 
<pre>
    entry_declaration ::=
       entry identifier [(discrete_range)] [formal_part]; 

    entry_call_statement ::= entry_name [actual_parameter_part]; 

    accept_statement ::=
       accept entry_simple_name [(entry_index)] [formal_part] [do
          sequence_of_statements
       end [entry_simple_name]]; 
    entry_index ::= expression 
</pre>
<P>
An entry declaration that includes a discrete range (see <a href="lrm-03-06.html#3.6.1">3.6.1</a>) declares  a
family  of distinct entries having the same formal part (if any);  that is,
one such entry for each value of the discrete range.  The term single entry
is used in the definition of any rule that applies to any entry other  than
one  of  a family.  The task designated by an object of a task type has (or
owns) the entries declared in the specification of the task type.  
<P>
Within the body of a task, each of its single entries or entry families can
be named by the corresponding simple name.  The  name  of  an  entry  of  a
family takes the form of an indexed component, the family simple name being
followed  by  the index in parentheses;  the type of this index must be the
same as that of the  discrete  range  in  the  corresponding  entry  family
declaration.   Outside  the  body of a task an entry name has the form of a
selected component,  whose  prefix  denotes  the  task  object,  and  whose
selector is the simple name of one of its single entries or entry families. 
<P>
A  single  entry overloads a subprogram, an enumeration literal, or another
single entry if they have the same identifier.  Overloading is not  defined  
for  entry  families.  A single entry or an entry of an entry family can be
renamed as a procedure as explained in section <a href="lrm-08-05.html#8.5">8.5</a>. 
<P>
The parameter modes defined for parameters of the formal part of  an  entry
declaration  are the same as for a subprogram declaration and have the same
meaning (see <a href="lrm-06-02.html#6.2">6.2</a>).  The syntax of an entry call  statement  is  similar  to
that   of   a  procedure  call  statement,  and  the  rules  for  parameter
associations are the same as for subprogram calls (see <a href="lrm-06-04.html#6.4.1">6.4.1</a> and <a href="lrm-06-04.html#6.4.2">6.4.2</a>).                                                 
<P>
An accept statement specifies the actions to be performed at a  call  of  a
named entry (it can be an entry of a family).  The formal part of an accept
statement  must  conform to the formal part given in the declaration of the
single entry or entry family named by the  accept  statement  (see  section
<a href="lrm-06-03.html#6.3.1">6.3.1</a>  for  the conformance rules).  If a simple name appears at the end of
an accept statement, it must repeat that given at the start. 
<P>
An accept statement for an entry of a given task is only allowed within the
corresponding task body;  excluding within the body  of  any  program  unit
that  is,  itself,  inner  to  the task body;  and excluding within another
accept statement for either the same single entry or an entry of  the  same
family.   (One  consequence  of this rule is that a task can execute accept
statements only for its own entries.)  A task body can  contain  more  than
one accept statement for the same entry. 
<P>
For the elaboration of an entry declaration, the discrete range, if any, is
evaluated  and  the  formal  part,  if  any,  is  then  elaborated as for a
subprogram declaration. 
<P>
Execution of an accept statement starts with the evaluation  of  the  entry
index  (in  the  case of an entry of a family).  Execution of an entry call
statement starts with the evaluation of the entry name;  this  is  followed
by any evaluations required for actual parameters in the same manner as for
a  subprogram call (see <a href="lrm-06-04.html#6.4">6.4</a>).  Further execution of an accept statement and
of a corresponding entry call statement are synchronized. 
<P>
If a given entry is called by only one task, there are  two  possibilities: 
<ul>
<li>If  the  calling  task  issues  an  entry  call  statement  before   a
corresponding  accept  statement  is  reached  by  the task owning the
entry, the execution of the calling task is suspended.<br><br> 
<li>If a task reaches an accept statement prior to any call of that entry,
the execution of the task is suspended until such a call is  received. 
</ul>
<P>
When an entry has been called and a corresponding accept statement has been
reached,  the  sequence  of  statements, if any, of the accept statement is
executed by the called task (while the  calling  task  remains  suspended).   
This  interaction is called a rendezvous.  Thereafter, the calling task and
the task owning the entry continue their execution in parallel. 
<P>
If several  tasks  call  the  same  entry  before  a  corresponding  accept
statement  is reached, the calls are queued;  there is one queue associated
with each entry.  Each execution of an accept statement  removes  one  call
from the queue.  The calls are processed in the order of arrival. 
<P>
An  attempt  to  call  an  entry of a task that has completed its execution
raises the exception TASKING_ERROR at the point of the call, in the calling
task;  similarly, this exception is raised at the point of the call if  the
called  task  completes  its  execution before accepting the call (see also
<a href="lrm-09-10.html#9.10">9.10</a> for the case when the called task becomes  abnormal).   The  exception
CONSTRAINT_ERROR  is  raised  if  the  index of an entry of a family is not
within the specified discrete range.   
<P>
Examples of entry declarations: 
<pre>
    entry READ(V : out ITEM);
    entry SEIZE;
    entry REQUEST(LEVEL)(D : ITEM);  --  a family of entries 
</pre>
<P>
Examples of entry calls: 
<pre>
    CONTROL.RELEASE;                      --  see <a href="lrm-09-02.html#9.2">9.2</a> and <a href="lrm-09-01.html#9.1">9.1</a>
    PRODUCER_CONSUMER.WRITE(E);           --  see <a href="lrm-09-01.html#9.1">9.1</a>
    POOL(5).READ(NEXT_CHAR);              --  see <a href="lrm-09-02.html#9.2">9.2</a> and <a href="lrm-09-01.html#9.1">9.1</a>
    CONTROLLER.REQUEST(LOW)(SOME_ITEM);   --  see <a href="lrm-09-01.html#9.1">9.1</a>                                             
</pre>
<P>
Examples of accept statements: 
<pre>
    accept SEIZE; 

    accept READ(V : out ITEM) do
       V := LOCAL_ITEM;
    end READ; 

    accept REQUEST(LOW)(D : ITEM) do
       ...
    end REQUEST; 
</pre>
<P>
Notes:    
<P>
The formal part given in an accept statement is not elaborated; it is  only
used to identify the corresponding entry. 
<P>
An  accept  statement   can  call  subprograms  that issue entry calls.  An
accept statement need not  have  a  sequence  of  statements  even  if  the
corresponding  entry  has  parameters.   Equally, it can have a sequence of
statements even if the corresponding entry has no parameters.  The sequence
of statements of an accept statement can include return statements.  A task
can call its own entries but it will, of course,  deadlock.   The  language
permits  conditional  and  timed  entry  calls  (see <a href="lrm-09-07.html#9.7.2">9.7.2</a> and <a href="lrm-09-07.html#9.7.3">9.7.3</a>).  The
language rules ensure that a task can only be in one entry queue at a given
time. 
<P>
If the bounds of  the  discrete  range  of  an  entry  family  are  integer
literals,  the  index (in an entry name or accept statement) must be of the
predefined type INTEGER (see <a href="lrm-03-06.html#3.6.1">3.6.1</a>).
