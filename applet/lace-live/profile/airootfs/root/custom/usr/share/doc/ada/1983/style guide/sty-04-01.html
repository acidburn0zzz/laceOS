<H3><a name="4.1">4.1     High-Level Structure</a></H3>
Well-structured programs are easily understood, enhanced, and maintained. 
Poorly structured programs are frequently restructured during maintenance just  
to make the job easier. Many of the guidelines listed below are often given as  
general program design guidelines.

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Place the specification of each library unit package in a separate 
file from its body. 
<li>Create an explicit specification, in a separate file, for each library  unit subprogram. 
<li>Use subunits for the bodies of large units which are nested in other units. 
<li>Place each subunit in a separate file. 
<li>Use a consistent file naming convention. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
The file names below illustrate one possible file organization and associated  
consistent naming convention. The library unit name is used for the body. A  
trailing underscore indicates the specification, and any files containing  
subunits use names constructed by separating the body name from the subunit  
name with two underscores.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>text_io_.ada                 -- the specification 
text_io.ada                  -- the body 
text_io__integer_io.ada      -- a subunit 
text_io__fixed_io.ada        -- a subunit 
text_io__float_io.ada        -- a subunit 
text_io__enumeration_io.ada  -- a subunit</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The main reason for the emphasis on separate files in this guideline is to 
minimize the amount of recompilation required after each change. Typically, 
during software development, bodies of units are updated far more often than 
specifications. If the body and specification reside in the same file, then 
the specification will be compiled each time the body is compiled, even though 
the specification has not changed. Because the specification defines the 
interface between the unit and all of its users, this recompilation of the 
specification typically makes recompilation of all users necessary, in order 
to verify compliance with the specification. If the specifications and bodies 
of the users also reside together, then any users of these units will also 
have to be recompiled, and so on. The ripple effect can force a huge number of 
compilations which could have been avoided, severely slowing the development 
and test phase of a project. This is why we suggest placing specifications of 
all library units (nonnested units) in separate files from their bodies.<P>
For the same reason, use subunits for large nested bodies, and put each 
subunit in its own file. This makes it possible to modify the body of the one 
nested unit without having to recompile any of the other units in the body. 
This is recommended for large units because changes are more likely to occur 
in large units than in small ones.<P>
An additional benefit of using multiple separate files is that it allows 
different implementers to modify different parts of the system at the same 
time with conventional editors which do not allow multiple concurrent updates 
to a single file.<P>
Finally, keeping bodies and specifications separate makes it possible to have 
multiple bodies for the same specification, or multiple specifications for the 
same body. Although Ada requires that there be exactly one specification per 
body in a system at any given time, it can still be useful to maintain 
multiple bodies or multiple specifications for use in different builds of a 
system. For example, a single specification may have multiple bodies, each of 
which implements the same functionality with a different tradeoff of time 
versus space efficiency. Or, for machine-dependent code, there may be one body 
for each target machine. Maintaining multiple package specifications can also 
be useful during development and test. You may develop one specification for 
delivery to your customer and another for unit testing. The first one would 
export only those subprograms intended to be called from outside of the 
package during normal operation of the system. The second one would export all 
subprograms of the package so that each of them could be independently tested.<P>
A consistent file naming convention is recommended to make it easier to manage  
the large number of files which may result from following this guideline.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use subprograms to enhance abstraction. 
<li>Restrict each subprogram to the performance of a single action. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Your program is required to output text to many types of devices. Because the  
devices would accept a variety of character sets, the proper way to do this is  
to write a subprogram to convert to the required character set. This way, the  
output subprogram has one purpose and the conversions are described elsewhere.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Subprograms are an extremely effective and well-understood abstraction 
technique. Subprograms increase program readability by hiding the details of a  
particular activity. It is not necessary that a subprogram be called more than  
once to justify its existence.

<H4>note</H4>
Dealing with the overhead of subroutine calls is discussed in <a href="sty-09-01.html#9.1.1">Guideline 9.1.1</a>.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="4.1.3">4.1.3   Functions</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use a function when the subprogram's primary purpose is to provide a  
single value. 
<li>Minimize the side effect of a function. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Although reading a character from a file will change what character is read  
next, this is accepted as a minor side effect compared to the primary purpose  
of the following function:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>function Next_Character return Character is separate;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
However, the use of a function like this should could lead to a subtle 
problem.  Any time the order of evaluation is undefined, the order of the 
values returned by the function will effectively be undefined.  In this 
example, the order of the characters placed in Word and the order that the 
following two characters are given to the Suffix parameters is unknown.  No 
implementation of the <CODE>Next_Character</CODE> function can guarantee which character 
will go where:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   Word : constant String := String'(1 .. 5 =&gt; Next_Character);

begin  -- Start_Parsing

   Parse(Keyword =&gt; Word, 
         Suffix1 =&gt; Next_Character, 
         Suffix2 =&gt; Next_Character); 
end Start_Parsing;</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Of course, if the order is unimportant (as in a random number generator), then  
the order of evaluation is unimportant.

<H4>rationale</H4>
A side effect is a change to any variable that is not local to the subprogram. 
This includes changes to variables by other subprograms and entries during 
calls from the function if the changes persist after the function returns. 
Side effects are discouraged because they are difficult to understand and 
maintain.  Additionally, the Ada language does not define the order in which 
functions are evaluated when they occur in expressions or as actual parameters 
to subprograms. Therefore, a program which depends on the order in which side 
effects of functions occur is erroneous. Avoid using side effects anywhere.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use packages for information hiding. 
<li>Use packages with private types for abstract data types. 
<li>Use packages to model abstract entities appropriate to the problem  
domain. 
<li>Use packages to group together related type and object declarations  
(e.g., common declarations for two or more library units). 
<li>Use packages to group together related program units for configuration  
control or visibility reasons (NASA 1987). 
<li>Encapsulate machine dependencies in packages. Place a software  
interface to a particular device in a package to facilitate a change to a  
different device. 
<li>Place low-level implementation decisions or interfaces in subprograms 
within packages. 
<li>Use packages and subprograms to encapsulate and hide program details  
that may change (Nissen and Wallis 1984). 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
A package called <CODE>Backing_Storage_Interface</CODE> could contain type and subprogram  
declarations to support a generalized view of an external memory system (such  
as a disk or drum). Its internals may, in turn, depend on other packages more  
specific to the hardware or operating system.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Packages are the principal structuring facility in Ada. They are intended to 
be used as direct support for abstraction, information hiding, and 
modularization.  For example, they are useful for encapsulating machine 
dependencies as an aid to portability. A single specification can have 
multiple bodies isolating implementation-specific information so other parts 
of the code do not need to change.<P>
Encapsulating areas of potential change helps to minimize the effort required 
to implement that change by preventing unnecessary dependencies among 
unrelated parts of the system.

<H4>note</H4>
The most prevalent objection to this guideline usually involves performance  
penalties.  See <a href="sty-09-01.html#9.1.1">Guideline 9.1.1</a> for a discussion about subprogram overhead.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Make each package serve a single purpose. 
<li>Use packages to group related data, types, and subprograms. 
<li>Avoid collections of unrelated objects and subprograms (NASA 1987 and  
Nissen and Wallis 1984). 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
As a bad example, a package named <CODE>Project_Definitions</CODE> is obviously a &quot;catch 
all&quot; for a particular project and is likely to be a jumbled mess. It probably  
has this form to permit project members to incorporate a single with clause  
into their software.<P>
Better examples are packages called <CODE>Display_Format_Definitions</CODE>, containing all  
the types and constants needed by some specific display in a specific format,  
and <CODE>Cartridge_Tape_Handler</CODE>, containing all the types, constants, and  
subprograms which provide an interface to a special purpose device.

<H4>rationale</H4>
See also <a href="sty-05-04.html#5.4.1">Guideline 5.4.1</a> on Heterogeneous Data.<P>
The degree to which the entities in a package are related has a direct impact  
on the ease of understanding packages and programs made up of packages. There  
are different criteria for grouping, and some criteria are less effective than  
others. Grouping the class of data or activity (e.g., initialization modules)  
or grouping data or activities based on their timing characteristics is less  
effective than grouping based on function or need to communicate through data  
(Charette 1986 paraphrased).

<H4>note</H4>
Traditional subroutine libraries often group functionally unrelated 
subroutines. Even such libraries should be broken into a collection of 
packages each containing a logically cohesive set of subprograms.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid declaring variables in package specifications. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
This is part of a compiler. Both the package handling error messages and the  
package containing the code generator need to know the current line number.  
Rather than storing this in a shared variable of type Natural, the information  
is stored in a package that hides the details of how such information is  
represented, and makes it available with access routines.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
package Compilation_Status is 
   type Line_Range is range 1 .. 2_500_000; 
   function Source_Line_Number return Line_Range; 
end Compilation_Status;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

with Compilation_Status; 
package Error_Message_Processing is 
   -- Handle compile-time diagnostic. 
end Error_Message_Processing;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

with Compilation_Status;

package Code_Generation is 
   -- Operations for code generation. 
end Code_Generation; 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Strongly coupled program units can be difficult to debug and very difficult to 
maintain. By protecting shared data with access functions, the coupling is 
lessened. This prevents dependence on the data structure and access to the 
data can be controlled.

<H4>note</H4>
The most prevalent objection to this guideline usually involves performance 
penalties.  When a variable is moved to the package body, subprograms to 
access the variable must be provided and the overhead involved during each 
call to those subprograms is introduced.  See <a href="sty-09-01.html#9.1.1">Guideline 9.1.1</a> for a discussion about 
subprogram overhead.<P>
