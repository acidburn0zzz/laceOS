The ability of tasks to interact with each other using Ada's intertask 
communication features makes it especially important to manage planned or 
unplanned (e.g., in response to a catastrophic exception condition) 
termination in a disciplined way. To do otherwise can lead to a proliferation 
of undesired and unpredictable side effects as a result of the termination of 
a single task.<P>

Allowing a task to terminate may not support the requirements of the system.  
Without an exception handler for the rendezvous within the main task loop, the  
functions of the task may not be performed.

<H4>note</H4>
The use of an exception handler is the only way to guarantee recovery from an 
entry call to an abnormal task. Use of the <CODE>'Terminated</CODE> attribute to test a 
task's availability before making the entry call can introduce a race 
condition where the tested task fails after the test but before the entry call 
(see <a href="sty-06-02.html#6.2.3">Guideline 6.2.3</a>).<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
A nonterminating task is a task whose body consists of a nonterminating loop 
with no selective wait with terminate, or a task that is dependent on a 
library package. Execution of a subprogram or block containing a task cannot 
complete until the task terminates. Any task that calls a subprogram 
containing a nonterminating task will be delayed indefinitely.<P>
The effect of unterminated tasks at the end of program execution is undefined. 
A task dependent on a library package cannot be forced to terminate using a 
selective wait construct with terminate alternative and should be terminated 
explicitly during program shutdown. One way to terminate tasks dependent on 
library packages is to provide them with exit entries. Have the main 
subprogram call the exit entry just before it terminates.<P>
Execution of an accept statement or of a selective wait statement without an  
else part, a delay, or a terminate alternative cannot proceed if no task ever  
calls the entry(s) associated with that statement.  This could result in  
deadlock.  Following this guideline entails programming multiple termination  
points in the task body.  A reader can easily &quot;know where to look&quot; for the 
normal termination points in a task body.  The termination points are the end  
of the body's sequence of statements, and alternatives of select statements.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
If you are simulating a cyclic executive, you may need a scheduling task that  
does not terminate. It has been said that no real-time system should be 
programmed to terminate. This is extreme. Systematic shutdown of many real-time 
systems is a desirable safety feature.<P>
If you are considering programming a task not to terminate, be certain that it  
is not a dependent of a block or subprogram from which the task's caller(s)  
will ever expect to return. Since entire programs can be candidates for reuse  
(see <a href="sty-08.html">Chapter 8</a>),
note that the task (and whatever it depends upon) will not  
terminate. Also be certain that for any other task that you do wish to  
terminate, its termination does not await this task's termination. Reread and  
fully understand <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-09-04.html#9.4">paragraph 9.4 of Department of Defense
(1983)</a> on &quot;Task Dependence - Termination of Tasks.&quot;<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid using the abort statement. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
If required in the application, provide a task entry for orderly shutdown.

<H4>rationale</H4>
When an abort statement is executed, there is no way to know what the targeted 
task was doing beforehand. Data for which the target task is responsible may 
be left in an inconsistent state. The overall effect on the system of aborting 
a task in such an uncontrolled way requires careful analysis. The system 
design must ensure that all tasks depending on the aborted task can detect the 
termination and respond appropriately.<P>
Tasks are not aborted until they reach a synchronization point such as  
beginning or end of elaboration, a delay statement, an accept statement, an  
entry call, a select statement, task allocation, or the execution of an  
exception handler. Consequently, the abort statement may not release processor  
resources as soon as you may expect. It also may not stop a runaway task  
because the task may be executing an infinite loop containing no  
synchronization points.<P>

<H4>example</H4>
This is one of many tasks updating the positions of blips on a radar screen. 
When started, it is given part of the name by which its parent knows it. 
Should it terminate due to an exception, it signals the fact in one of its 
parent's data structures.

   My_Index : Track_Index;

      accept Start (Who_Am_I : in     Track_Index) do 
         My_Index := Who_Am_I; 
      end Start; 
      Neutral := False; 
      ...

      terminate; 
   end select;

   when others =&gt;

<H4>rationale</H4>
A task will terminate if an exception is raised within it for which it has no  
handler. In such a case, the exception is not propagated outside of the task  
(unless it occurs during a rendezvous). The task simply dies with no  
notification to other tasks in the program. Therefore, providing exception  
handlers within the task, and especially a handler for <CODE>others</CODE>, ensures that a  
task can regain control after an exception occurs. If the task cannot proceed  
normally after handling an exception, this affords it the opportunity to shut  
itself down cleanly and to notify tasks responsible for error recovery  
necessitated by the abnormal termination of the task.

<H4>note</H4>
Do not use the task status to determine if a rendezvous can be made with the 
task. If task A is dependent on task B and task A checks the status flag 
before it rendezvous with task B, there is a potential that task B fails 
between the status test and the rendezvous. In this case, task A must provide 
an exception handler to handle the <CODE>Tasking_Error</CODE> exception raised by the call 
to an entry of an abnormal task (see <a href="#6.3.1">Guideline 6.3.1</a>).<P>
