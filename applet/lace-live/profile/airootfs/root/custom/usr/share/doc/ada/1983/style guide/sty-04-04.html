<UL>
<li>  Place the specification of each library unit package in a separate 
file from its body. 
<li>Create an explicit specification, in a separate file, for each library  
unit subprogram. 
<li> Use subunits for the bodies of large units which are nested in other  
units. 
<li>Place each subunit in a separate file. 
<li>Use a consistent file naming convention. 
<li>Use subprograms to enhance abstraction. 
<li>Restrict each subprogram to the performance of a single action. 
<li>Use a function when the subprogram's primary purpose is to provide a  
single value. 
<li>Minimize the side effect of a function. 
<li>Use packages for information hiding. 
<li>Use packages with private types for abstract data types. 
<li>Use packages to model abstract entities appropriate to the problem  
domain. 
<li>Use packages to group together related type and object declarations  
(e.g., common declarations for two or more library units). 
<li>Use packages to group together related program units for configuration  
control or visibility reasons. 
<li>Encapsulate machine dependencies in packages. Place a software  
interface to a particular device in a package to facilitate a change to a  
different device. 
<li>Place low-level implementation decisions or interfaces in subprograms 
within packages. 
<li>Use packages and subprograms to encapsulate and hide program details  
that may change. 
<li>Make each package serve a single purpose. 
<li>Use packages to group functionally related data, types, and  
subprograms. 
<li>Avoid collections of unrelated objects and subprograms. 
<li>Avoid putting variables in package specifications. 
<li>Use tasks to model abstract, asynchronous entities within the problem  
domain. 
<li>Use tasks to control or synchronize access to tasks or other  
asynchronous entities (e.g., asynchronous I/O, peripheral devices, interrupts). 
<li>Use tasks to define concurrent algorithms for multiprocessor  
architectures. 
<li>Use tasks to perform concurrent, cyclic, or prioritized activities. 
</UL>

<H4><a name="4.4.2">4.2 visibility</a></H4>
<UL>
<li>Put only what is needed for the use of a package into its  
specification. 
<li>Minimize the number of declarations in package specifications. 
<li>Do not include extra operations simply because they are easy to build. 
<li>Minimize the context (<CODE>with</CODE>) clauses in a package specification. 
<li>Reconsider subprograms which seem to require large numbers of  
parameters. 
<li>Do not manipulate global data within a subprogram or package merely to  
limit the number of parameters. 
<li>Avoid unnecessary visibility; hide the implementation details of a  
program unit from its users. 
<li>Nest package specifications within another package specification only  
for grouping operations, hiding common implementation details, or presenting  
different views of the same abstraction. 
<li>  Restrict the visibility of program units as much as possible by 
nesting them inside other program units and hiding them inside package bodies. 
<li>Minimize the scope within which <CODE>with</CODE> clauses apply.  
<li>Only <CODE>with</CODE> those units directly needed. 
<li>Carefully consider encapsulation of tasks. 
</UL>

<H4><a name="4.4.3">4.3 exceptions</a></H4>
<UL>
<li>Declare a different exception name for each error that the user of a  
unit can make. 
<li>Declare a different exception name for each unavoidable and  
unrecoverable internal error which can occur in a unit.  
<li>Do not borrow an exception name from another context. 
<li>Export (declare visibly to the user) the names of all exceptions which  
can be raised. 
<li>In a package, document which exceptions can be raised by each  
subprogram and task entry. 
<li>Do not raise exceptions for internal errors which can be avoided or  
corrected within the unit. 
<li>Do not raise the same exception to report different types of errors  
which are distinguishable by the user of the unit. 
<li>  Provide interrogative functions which allow the user of a unit to 
avoid causing exceptions to be raised. 
<li>When possible, avoid changing state information in a unit before  
raising an exception. 
<li>Catch and convert or handle all predefined and compiler-defined 
exceptions at the earliest opportunity. 
<li>Do not explicitly raise predefined or implementation-defined 
exceptions. 
<li>Never let an exception propagate beyond its scope.
