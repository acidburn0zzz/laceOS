<H2>CHAPTER 10: Separate Compilation and Libraries</H2>

<H3><a name="10.1">10.1 Introduction</a></H3>

Separate compilation  of program  units is  a practical necessity. Its
basic goals  are to  permit the  separation  of  large  programs  into
simpler, more  manageable parts,  and to  create libraries  of program
units. Separate  compilation helps  to reduce compilation costs and to
simplify the  development and  management of  program corrections  and
modifications.
<p>
For large projects involving several programmers, separate compilation
permits program  texts to  be  separated  physically  in  a  way  that
reflects the  division of  work and  responsibilities. Once the common
interface between two parts has been agreed upon and recorded, the two
parts can  be developed  and compiled  separately. The  fact that  the
common  interface  is  a  physically  separate  text  guarantees  that
separate recompilation  of either  part does not invalidate the common
interface.
<p>
The physical  separation of  program texts  may be viewed as a support
facility for  the structured programming concept of refinement. It may
also be  used to  conceal the text of a subprogram body from users who
are only  allowed to  call the  subprogram. Such  concealment  may  be
justified either for reasons of confidentiality or in order to prevent
the user  from inferring  implicit properties  or  making  assumptions
regarding the  functioning of  the subprogram.  Finally this  physical
separation facilitates  the construction  of  libraries  and  reusable
software components.
<p>
It is  appropriate at  this stage to introduce the distinction between
independent  and   separate  compilation   (following  J.J.  Horning).
Independent compilation  has been  achieved by most assembly languages
and also  by languages  such  as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a>  and  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">PL/1</a>.  Compilation  of
individual modules  is performed  independently in  the sense that the
modules have  no way  of sharing  knowledge of  properties defined  in
other modules.
<p>
Independent compilation  is usually  achieved with  a lower  level  of
compile-time checking  of consistency  between units  than is possible
within  a   single  compilation   unit.  In  consequence,  independent
compilation came  into disrepute  and was  rejected  by  safety-minded
early typed  language definitions  such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 68</a>  and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>. Fast
compilation of  the complete  program was often advocated by promoters
of these  languages as  a safe alternative to independent compilation.
However, fast  compilation has  its limits, and it fails to answer the
needs of confidentiality and libraries.
<p>
Separate compilation,  on the  other  hand,  reconciles  type-checking
safety and  the pragmatic  reasons for compiling in parts. It is based
on the  use of  a program  library which contains a record of previous
compilations of  the units  that form a program. It has been developed
in the  language Sue  and in later languages such as <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Jossle</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Mesa</a>
and later  extensions of  Pascal and  Algol 68.  We next  discuss  its
properties in terms of what is provided in Ada.
<p>
When a  program unit  is submitted  to the compiler, the compiler also
has access to the program library and is therefore able to perform the
same level of checking (in particular type checking) whether a program
is compiled  in many  parts or  as a whole. It is the existence of the
program  library   that  makes   the  compilation   separate  but  not
independent.
<p>
Using the  general information  available in  the program library, the
compiler will be able to assist the user in organizing recompilations.
In particular,  it will  be able  to  display  information  about  the
current state  of the  compilation of  a program  that is divided into
several compilation  units: which  separate program  units  have  been
compiled,  and   which  need   to  be   recompiled  because  of  prior
recompilations.
<p>
It is  thus for  reasons of  safety and  utility  that  Ada  offers  a
powerful facility  for separate  compilation. Two  additional criteria
have been  followed in  this design,  namely  simplicity  of  use  and
simplicity of implementation.
<p>
Separate compilation  being a  user-oriented facility,  it  should  be
simple to  understand and  use. Consequently  it should  not introduce
other  concepts   than  those  required  by  the  nature  of  separate
compilation. Scope  rules and  the general form of separately compiled
program units should be similar to those of other program units.
<p>
In addition,  separate compilation  should be implementable simply and
efficiently. The  additional work  required for  separate  compilation
should stay  within reasonable  limits, since  one of  the goals is to
save overall compilation and recompilation time.
