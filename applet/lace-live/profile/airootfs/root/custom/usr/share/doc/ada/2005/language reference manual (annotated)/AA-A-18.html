Presuming f is some function of a length parameter N and t(N) is the 
time the operation takes (on average or worst case, as specified) for

<SPAN class="insert2">This clause provides a number of useful containers 
for Ada. Only the most useful containers are provided. Ones that are 
relatively easy to code, redundant, or rarely used are omitted from this 
set, even if they are generally included in containers libraries.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.b/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">The containers packages 
are modeled on the Standard Template Library (STL), an algorithms and 
data structure library popularized by Alexander Stepanov, and included 
in the C++ standard library. The structure and terminology differ from 
the STL where that better maps to common Ada usage. For instance, what 
the STL calls &ldquo;iterators&rdquo; are called &ldquo;cursors&rdquo; 
here.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.c/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><SPAN class="insert2">The

<DIV Class="paranum">4.j/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">Separate versions for 
definite and indefinite element types are provided, as those for definite 
types can be implemented more efficiently.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.k/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">Each container includes 
a cursor, which is a reference to an element within a container. Cursors 
generally remain valid as long as the container exists and the element 
referenced is not deleted. Many operations on cursors are common to all 
of the containers. This makes it possible to write generic algorithms 
that work on any kind of container.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.l/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">The containers packages 
are structured so that additional packages can be added in the future. 
Indeed, we hope that these packages provide the basis for a more extensive 
secondary standard for containers.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.m/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">If containers with similar 
functionality (but different performance characteristics) are provided 
(by the implementation or by a secondary standard), we suggest that a 
prefix be used to identify the class of the functionality: &quot;Ada.Containers.Bounded_Sets&quot; 
(for a set with a maximum number of elements); &quot;Ada.Containers.Protected_Maps&quot; 
(for a map which can be accessed by multiple tasks at one time); &quot;Ada.Containers.Persistent_Vectors&quot; 
(for a persistent vector which continues to exist between executions 
of a program) and so on.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.n/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><SPAN class="insert2">Note 
that the language already includes several requirements that are important 
to the use of containers. These include:</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.o/2</DIV>
<UL Class="SmallBulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC><SPAN class="insert2">Library 
packages must be reentrant &ndash; multiple tasks can use the packages 
as long as they operate on separate containers. Thus, it is only necessary 
for a user to protect a container if a single container needs to be used 
by multiple tasks.</SPAN></LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.p/2</DIV>
<UL Class="SmallBulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC><SPAN class="insert2">Language-defined 
types must stream &quot;properly&quot;. That means that the stream attributes 
can be used to implement persistence of containers when necessary, and 
containers can be passed between partitions of a program.</SPAN></LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.q/2</DIV>
<UL Class="SmallBulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC><SPAN class="insert2">Equality 
of language-defined types must compose &ldquo;properly&rdquo;. This means 
that the version of &quot;=&quot; directly used by users is the same 
one that will be used in generics and in predefined equality operators 
of types with components of the containers and/or cursors. This prevents 
the abstraction from breaking unexpectedly.</SPAN></LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.r/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">If a container's element 
type is controlled, the point at which the element is finalized will 
depend on the implementation of the container. We do not specify precisely 
where this will happen (it will happen no later than the finalization 
of the container, of course) in order to give implementation's flexibility 
to cache, block, or split the nodes of the container. In particular, 
Delete does not necessarily finalize the element; the implementation 
may (or may not) hold the space for reuse.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.s/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">This is not likely to 
be a hardship, as the element type has to be nonlimited. Types used to 
manage scarce resources generally need to be limited. Otherwise, the 
amount of resources needed is hard to control, as the language allows 
a lot of variation in the number or order of adjusts/finalizations. For 
common uses of nonlimited controlled types such as managing storage, 
the types already have to manage arbitrary copies.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.t/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2">The use of controlled 
type also brings up the possibility of failure of finalization (and thus 
deallocation) of an element. This is a &ldquo;serious bug&rdquo;, as 
AI-179 puts it, so we don't try to specify what happens in that case. 
The implementation should propagate the exception.</SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.u/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2"><B>Implementation Note: 
</B>It is expected that exceptions propagated from these operations do 
not damage containers. That is, if Storage_Error is propagated because 
of an allocation failure, or Constraint_Error is propagated by the assignment 
of elements, the container can continue to be used without further exceptions. 
The intent is that it should be possible to recover from errors without 
losing data. We don't try to state this formally in most cases, because 
it is hard to define precisely what is and is not allowed behavior.</SPAN> 
</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">4.v/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="insert2"><B>Implementation Note: 
</B>When this clause says that the behavior of something is unspecified{<I>unspecified</I> 
[partial]} <A NAME="I6564"></A>, we really mean that any result of executing 
Ada code short of erroneous execution is allowed. We do not mean that 
memory not belonging to the parameters of the operation can be trashed. 
When we mean to allow erroneous behavior, we specifically say that execution 
is erroneous. All this means if the containers are written in Ada is 
that checks should not be suppressed or removed assuming some behavior 
of other code, and that the implementation should take care to avoid 
creating internal dangling accesses by assuming behavior from generic 
formals that can't be guaranteed. We don't try to say this normatively 
because it would be fairly complex, and implementers are unlikely to 
increase their support costs by fielding implementations that are unstable 
if given buggy hash functions, et al.</SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
