<h1>
Appendix X   Upward Compatibility
</h1>

<p>
A major design goal of Ada 95 was to avoid or at least minimize the need
for modifying the existing base of Ada 83 software to make it compatible
with Ada 95.  This involves not only pursuing upward compatibility but
also preserving implementation-dependent behavior that can currently be
relied upon.  In common with the experience of revising other language
standards, it is infeasible to guarantee 100% compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Other languages have been more or less successful in meeting this
goal.  For example, COBOL 83 has been very successful in achieving upward
compatibility with COBOL 74.  Nevertheless some minor incompatibilities
were introduced which affect existing programs.  For example,
IS_ALPHABETIC, accepts upper and lower case in the new COBOL standard.
The transition from C to ANSI C and from there to C++ has also caused
incompatibilities, for example C++ requires all procedure definitions in
old-style C to be modified.
</p>
<p>
   In the design of Ada 95, a very conservative approach has been
adopted.  The few incompatibilities that exist can be dealt with in a
simple mechanical way.  For example, the introduction of a small number
of reserved words requires their replacement in any program using them as
identifiers.  Extensive surveys of existing code show few programs to be
affected.  Most of the other incompatibilities involve obscure or
pathological programming styles which are expected to appear very
infrequently in existing code.
</p>
<p>
   The great majority of programs will not be significantly affected by
these changes - the most likely incompatibilities being automatically
detected at compilation time.  Moreover, tools are being developed to aid
in the reliable detection of any problems and thereby smooth the process
of transition.
</p>
<p>
   Only three incompatibilities are considered likely to occur in normal
programs.  They are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
New reserved words - In Ada 95, six new reserved words have been added to
     the language.
<li>
Type Character has 256 positions - In Ada 95, the type Character has 256
     positions.  In Ada 83, it had 128 positions.
<li>
Unconstrained generic parameters - In Ada 95, different syntax must be
     used in a generic formal parameter to allow unconstrained actual
     parameters.
</ul>
<p>
The following further two incompatibilities might occur in normal
programs but are less likely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Library package bodies illegal if not required - In Ada 95, it is illegal
     to provide a body for a library package that does not require one.
<li>
Numeric_Error renames Constraint_Error - In Ada 95, the declaration for
     Numeric_Error has been changed to a renaming of Constraint_Error.
</ul>
<p>
   These incompatibilities usually cause a legal Ada 83 program to be an
illegal Ada 95 program and hence are detected at compile time.  They are
described in more detail in the ensuing sections.  In each case we give
an example of the incompatibility, an indication of how it can be avoided
in existing Ada 83 programs and the possibility of its automatic
detection and removal.
</p>
<p>
   The remaining incompatibilities which are considered very unlikely to
occur in normal programs are briefly considered in X.6.
</p>
<p>
   The reader should note that we say that an incompatibility is
consistent if the worst that can happen is that a legal Ada 83 program
becomes illegal in Ada 95 and thus fails to compile.  An incompatibility
is said to be inconsistent if the program can remain legal but have a
different meaning.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=1>
X.1  Reserved Words
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Six new reserved words are introduced in Ada 95: abstract, aliased,
protected, requeue, tagged, and until.
</p>
<p>
   Two alternatives to new reserved words were considered: a new concept
of unreserved keywords or the use of combinations of existing reserved
words.  Neither of these options was considered preferable to the
transitory inconvenience caused by the introduction of the new reserved
words.
</p>
<p>
   An Ada 83 program that uses any of these words as identifiers is an
illegal Ada 95 program.  For example, the following fragment of Ada 83
will fail to compile in Ada 95 because it uses two of the new reserved
words
<pre>
   Protected: Boolean := False;

   procedure Requeue(The_Activity: Activity; On_Queue: Queue);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Avoidance is clearly straightforward - avoid use of these six words as
identifiers.  Detection of the incompatibility is also straightforward.
Automatic correction is problematic - to ensure that a name change is
valid requires significant analysis especially if the identifier is the
name of a library unit, or occurs in a package specification for which
use clauses occur.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=2>
X.2  Type Character
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In Ada 95, the type Character has 256 positions.  In Ada 83, it had 128
positions.
</p>
<p>
   Although suitable for English-speaking nations, a character type based
on ASCII is inappropriate for most of Europe.  ISO has defined a number
of 256 character standards such as Latin-1 and Latin-2.  This change to
the language thus accommodates non-English speaking nations.
</p>
<p>
   An Ada 83 program could be an illegal Ada 95 program if it has a case
statement or an array indexed by Character, but it could be a legal Ada
95 program with different semantics if it relies on the position number
or value of Character'Last.  For example
<pre>
   type Char_Kind is (Numeric, Alphabetic, Other);

   Kind_Array: array (Character) of Char_Kind :=         -- (1)
                 ('0' .. '9' => Numeric,
                  'A' .. 'Z' | 'a' .. 'z' => Alphabetic,
                  others => Other);

   case Char is                                          -- (2)
      when Character'Val(0) .. Character'Val(63) => ...
      when Character'Val(64) .. Character'Val(127) => ...
   end case;

   I: Integer := Character'Pos(Character'Last);          -- (3)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Declaration (1) is legal in Ada 95 but probably does not achieve the
desired effect.  Statement (2) is illegal in Ada 95 and will be detected
at compilation.  Statement (3) illustrates a situation where the program
will still execute but have a different effect in Ada 95 (it is
inconsistent).
</p>
<p>
   As it is likely that allowing for 256 characters is outside the scope
of the original requirement for the program concerned, avoidance is not
really the issue - a review of the requirements is necessary.
</p>
<p>
   The inconsistency illustrated by the third example can be avoided by
not depending on the position or value of Character'Last.  Avoiding the
other incompatibilities avoids the real issue of how the extra 128
characters are to be handled.  Unless uniform behavior is acceptable for
these extra characters, use of an others choice, whilst ensuring a legal
(but bad style) Ada 95 program might cause unacceptable behavior.
</p>
<p>
   Detection of the consistent incompatibilities is straightforward;
detection that an inconsistency may arise is possible.  Manual correction
is necessary to determine whether the required semantics of the program
are those defined by Ada 95.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, it should be noted that the ISO Working Group with
responsibility for maintaining the Ada standard, has decreed that this
change can be introduced into Ada 83 compilers, so this will increasingly
become an Ada 83 portability issue as more implementations support 256
characters.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=3>
X.3  Library Package Bodies
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In Ada 95, library unit packages are allowed to have a body only if
required by language rules.  This avoids a nasty and not so rare error.
</p>
<p>
   In Ada 83, a body need only be provided for a package that really
needed one, such as where the specification contains subprogram or task
declarations.  If a body was provided for a library package that did not
need a body (for performing initializations for example), then if the
package specification was subsequently changed, the body became obsolete.
However, since it was optional, subsequent builds incorporating the
package would not incorporate the body, unless it was manually
recompiled.  This obviously affects packages, for example, that only
declare types, constants and/or exceptions, a very common occurrence.  As
a trivial example in Ada 83 consider
<pre>
   package Optional_Body is
      Global_Variable: Integer;
   end Optional_Body;

   -----------------------------------------

   with Integer_Function;
   package body Optional_Body is
   begin
      Global_Variable := Integer_Function;
   end Optional_Body;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   The solution adopted in Ada 95 is to allow a body for a library unit
package only when one is required by some language rule; the above
example is therefore illegal in Ada 95.  However, the pragma
Elaborate_Body can be used to cause a body to be required.
</p>
<p>
   Given the non-uniform functionality of program libraries and
sublibraries, it is probably wise not to try to automatically detect, let
alone correct, this incompatibility.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=4>
X.4  Indefinite Generic Parameters
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Ada 95 provides new syntax for a generic formal private type to indicate
that the actual subtype is allowed to be indefinite.  The old syntax is
retained, but the meaning is changed to require definite actual
parameters.
</p>
<p>
   In Ada 83, no indication was given in a generic formal type
declaration as to whether the actual needed to be definite, for example
because the body declared an uninitialized variable for the type.  It was
thus possible for a legal instantiation to become illegal if the body was
changed.
</p>
<p>
   An Ada 83 program, where an indefinite type is used as a generic
actual parameter is an illegal Ada 95 program.  For example the following
legal Ada 83 program is illegal in Ada 95
<pre>
   generic
      type Element_Type is private;
   package Stack is ...

   ------------------------------------------------------

   with Stack;
   package String_Stack is new Stack(Element_Type => String);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   There is no way to avoid this incompatibility but an Ada 83 program
can be annotated with an appropriate comment, thus
<pre>
   generic
      type Element_Type is private;  -- !! (<>) in Ada 95
   package Stack ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Detection of the incompatibility is straightforward.  Manual
correction is necessary to determine whether restricting the actual to
being definite is acceptable.
</p>
<p>
   It is interesting to note that some predefined library units in Ada 83
used this feature and so are changed.  Examples are Unchecked_Conversion
and Unchecked_Deallocation and also Sequential_IO.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, it should be noted that the ISO Working Group has recommended
that Ada 83 compilers be allowed to accept the new syntax in order to
simplify transition.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=5>
X.5  Numeric Error
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In Ada 95, the exception Numeric_Error is declared in the package
Standard as a renaming of Constraint_Error.
</p>
<p>
   The checks that could cause Numeric_Error to be raised in Ada 83 have
all been reworded to cause Constraint_Error to be raised instead.
Indeed, this change has been sanctioned by the Ada Rapporteur Group and
encouraged in existing Ada 83 implementations.
</p>
<p>
   However, the alternative of completely removing Numeric_Error was
rejected because it would naturally have caused an incompatibility in
programs using the construction
<pre>
   when Numeric_Error | Constraint_Error => Some_Action;
</pre>
which is the currently recommended way of avoiding the confusion between
Numeric_Error and Constraint_Error in Ada 83.
</p>
<p>
   This construction is still allowed in Ada 95 because of an additional
rule that permits an exception to be mentioned more than once in the same
handler.
</p>
<p>
   Programs which do have distinct separate handlers for Numeric_Error
and Constraint_Error such as
<pre>
   exception
      when Constraint_Error => Action_1;
      when Numeric_Error => Action_2;
   end;
</pre>
are illegal in Ada 95.  Moreover, an inconsistency will arise if a frame
has an explicit handler for Numeric_Error or Constraint_Error but not
both as in the following
<pre>
   exception
      when Constraint_Error => Action_1;
      when others => Action_2;
   end;
</pre>
since Numeric_Error will be caught by the first handler in Ada 95 but by
the second in Ada 83.
</p>
<p>
   Detection of the incompatibility is straightforward but manual
correction will be necessary in cases where Numeric_Error is treated
differently.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=6>
X.6  Other Incompatibilities
</a>
</h2>

<p>
It is considered that other incompatibilities will be unlikely to occur
in normal programs - the Ada 83 semantics being known only to the most
erudite of Ada programmers - and so only a brief description seems
appropriate in this document.  In the following summary, they are grouped
according to whether they result in a legal Ada 95 program but with
different semantics; whether they would be detectable by an Ada 95
compiler and so on.
</p>

<h3>
<a name=6-1>
X.6.1  Unlikely Inconsistencies
</a>
</h3>

<p>
These incompatibilities might cause a change in the runtime behavior, but
they are not thought likely to occur in normal programs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>  
Derived type inherits all operations of parent - In Ada 95 a derived type
     inherits all its parent's primitive operations previously declared
     in the same declarative part.  In Ada 83, it did not.
<li>
Floating point types may have less precision - the chosen representation
     for a floating point type may have less precision in Ada 95 for
     hardware with a non-binary radix.
<li>
Fixed point types may have less precision - the chosen representation for
     a fixed point type may have less precision in Ada 95.  This is
     related to the next item.
<li>
Default Small for fixed point types - In Ada 83, the default value of
     Small was defined to be the largest power of two not exceeding
     S'Delta.  In Ada 95, it is allowed to be a smaller power of two.
<li>
Rounding from real to integer is deterministic - Rounding is defined in
     Ada 95 as away from zero if the real number is midway between two
     integers.
<li>
Evaluation order of defaulted generic actual parameters - The order of
     evaluation of defaulted generic actuals is arbitrary in Ada 95.
<li>
Static expressions evaluated exactly - Static expressions are always
     evaluated exactly in Ada 95.  In Ada 83 this was only required in a
     static context.
</ul>

<h3>
<a name=6-2>
X.6.2  Unlikely Incompatibilities
</a>
</h3>

<p>
These incompatibilities cause a legal Ada 83 program to be an illegal Ada
95 program and hence are detectable at compile time.  They are considered
to be unlikely in normal programs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>  
Bad pragmas illegal - In Ada 95, a pragma with an error in its arguments
     makes the compilation illegal.  In Ada 83, it was ignored.
<li>
S'Base not defined for composite subtypes - In Ada 95, S'Base is not
     defined for a composite subtype S.
<li>
Wide_Character shares all character literals - As a result of adding
     types Wide_Character and Wide_String to package Standard, Ada 95
     character literals are always overloaded and Ada 95 string literals
     are always overloaded.
<li>
Definition of freezing tightened - In Ada 95, range constraints on a type
     after its declaration and in occurrences in pragmas freeze the
     representation (are treated as forcing occurrences).  In Ada 83 they
     were not treated as forcing occurrences.
<li>
Static matching of subtypes - In Ada 95, matching of subtypes is now
     performed statically instead of at runtime (as in Ada 83) in array
     conversions and generic instantiations.
<li>
Illegal to use value of deferred constant - In Ada 95 it is illegal to
     use the value of a deferred constant before it is set.  In Ada 83 it
     was erroneous.
<li>
Explicit constraints in uninitialized allocators designating access types
     - in Ada 95 such constraints are illegal; in Ada 83 they were
     ignord.
<li>
Exceptions in static expressions illegal - in Ada 95, it is illegal to
     raise an exception in a static expression; in Ada 83 it made the
     expression non-static.
<li>
Preference for universal numeric operators - In Ada 95, the overload
     resolution rules have been changed to simplify them.  As a
     consequence certain pathological Ada 83 programs become illegal.
<li>
Assume worst when checking generic bodies - Ada 83 generic contract model
     violations have been overcome in Ada 95 by assuming the worst case
     in a generic body.
<li>
New identifiers added to package System - New identifiers in package
     System may introduce illegalities into a unit having a use clause
     for System.
<li>
Append_Mode added to File_Mode enumeration - In Ada 95, subtype File_Mode
     in packages Sequential_IO and Text_IO has an extra literal,
     Append_Mode.
<li>
New identifiers added to package Text_IO - New identifiers in package
     Ada.Text_IO may introduce illegalities into a unit having a use
     clause for Text_IO.
<li>
New identifiers added to package Standard - New identifiers in package
     Standard may clash with existing use-visible identifiers.
<li>
Functions returning local variables containing tasks - In Ada 95 it is
     illegal or raises Program_Error if a function with a result type
     with a task subcomponent returns a local variable.  In Ada 83 it was
     erroneous to return a variable containing a local task.
<li>
Illegal to change representation of types containing tasks - In Ada 95,
     it is illegal to give a representation item for a derived type
     containing a task.
<li>
Character literals always visible - In Ada 95, character literals are
     visible everywhere.  In Ada 83 they followed the usual rules of
     visibility.
</ul>

<h3>
<a name=6-3>
X.6.3  Implementation Dependent Incompatibilities
</a>
</h3>

<p>
These incompatibilities only arise with some implementations.  They occur
either as a result of tightening up Ada semantics or where an Ada 83
implementation has used an identifier now predefined in Ada 95.  In the
latter case, an inconsistency could occur if the Ada 83 use of the
identifier is compatible with the Ada 95 use, though this is unlikely.
</p>
<ul>
<li>  
Real attributes replaced - The Ada 83 attributes for a real subtype S
     (such as S'Mantissa) have been replaced by Ada 95 attributes defined
     in the Numerics Annex.
<li>
Certain pragmas removed - Some pragmas (including Interface and Shared)
     have been removed from the language and Priority has been moved to
     the Real-Time Systems annex.
<li>
New pragmas defined - The names of new pragmas may clash with
     implementation-defined pragmas.
<li>
New attributes defined - The names of new attributes may clash with
     implementation-defined attributes.
<li>
New library units defined - The names of new (language-defined) library
     units may clash with user-defined or implementation-defined library
     units.
</ul>

<h3>
<a name=6-4>
X.6.4  Error Incompatibilities
</a>
</h3>

<p>
These incompatibilities only occur in programs containing runtime errors,
either detectable (an exception is raised) or undetectable (the execution
is erroneous).
</p>
<ul>
<li>  
Exceeding 'First or 'Last of an unconstrained floating point type - In
     Ada 95, the 'First and 'Last of a floating point type declared
     without a range constraint are treated as minimum bounds and may be
     exceeded without causing Constraint_Error.
<li>
Dependent compatibility checks performed on object declaration - In Ada
     95, dependent compatibility checks are performed on object
     declaration.  In Ada 83, they were performed on subtype declaration.
<li>
Implicit array subtype conversion - Ada 95 allows sliding in more
     situations than did Ada 83, so Constraint_Error might not be raised
     as in Ada 83.
<li>
Lower bound of catenation changed for constrained array types - In Ada
     95, the lower bound of the result of catenation for a constrained
     array type is defined to be 'First of the index subtype.  In Ada 83,
     the lower bound of the result was 'First of the left operand.
<li>
Raising Time_Error deferred - In Ada 95, raising  Time_Error can be
     deferred until Split or Year is called, or might not be raised at
     all.  In Ada 83, it is raised on "+" or "-".
<li>
Data format for Get - In Ada 95, Get for real types accepts a wider range
     of formats which would raise Data_Error in Ada 83.  Leading and
     trailing zeros and the radix point are not required.
</ul>

<h2>
<a name=7>
X.7  Conclusion
</a>
</h2>

<p>
This appendix has outlined the incompatibilities between Ada 83 and Ada
95.  As we have seen, the small number that are likely to occur in
practice are easily overcome.  The remainder are unlikely to be
encountered in normal programs but have been mentioned for completeness.
For further details the reader should consult the comprehensive
discussion in [Taylor 95] upon which this discussion has been based.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, it is clear that there are unlikely to be significant
transition issues for the vast majority of Ada 83 programs.  Ada 95 has
been carefully designed to minimize incompatibilities while meeting the
overall goals of the requirements.
