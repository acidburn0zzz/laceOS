<H2>CHAPTER 5: Numeric Types</H2>

<H3><a name="5.5">5.5 Conclusion</a></H3>

The aim  of the  design is  to  provide  the  full  range  of  numeric
facilities within  a secure system of types. This has been achieved by
a combination of two techniques.
<p>
Firstly, use  is made  of the  ability in  the language  to define new
types derived  from an existing type, from which the new types inherit
properties. The  convenience of  the derived  type mechanism in Ada is
that it  provides a  simple  method  of  ensuring  a  high  degree  of
portability. If the user declares a new type (therefore derived from a
machine type),  this type is distinct from other types in the program.
This distinction ensures that type conversions are explicit and that a
quite different representation could be used on other machines.
<p>
Secondly, the  precision of numerical representation and the bounds on
results  of  computation  are  strictly  controlled:  With  the  model
developed by Brown, it is possible to define an axiomatic system which
gives the minimal properties of approximate computation. These minimal
accuracy properties  could be  exploited by  a diagnostic  or  program
analysis  system   to  ensure   that  the   algorithm  being  used  is
appropriate. The  axiomatic system  is realistic  in the sense that it
can (and must) be applied to existing floating point implementations.
<p>
The numeric  types available  to the programmer are derived from those
defined in  the implementation. This guarantees that the efficiency of
the resulting  code is directly related to that of the implementation,
which, in  the case of floating point, could be hardware, firmware, or
software. Fixed  point  types  are  not  predefined  in  the  standard
environment, but  acquire their properties on declaration. However, in
terms of  code generation  these properties  involve little  more than
what is  required for the integers and hence the performance should be
high.
<p>
Portability cannot  be entirely  guaranteed by the language because it
is  not  possible  for  a  program  to  be  completely  isolated  from
dependence on  the underlying  hardware. However,  such dependence  is
limited to  the  attributes  of  the  predefined  numeric  types,  and
properties of  the implemented  real types that cannot be derived from
the axiomatic  system -  such as  the radix of the underlying floating
point representation.
<p>
To conclude,  the numeric  types in  Ada  provide  facilities  clearly
needed by  the envisaged  applications. A rigorous axiomatic system is
available to  handle approximate computation. Most importantly, a good
balance between portability and efficiency has been achieved.
