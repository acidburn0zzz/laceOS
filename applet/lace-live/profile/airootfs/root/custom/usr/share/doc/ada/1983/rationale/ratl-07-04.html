<H2>CHAPTER 7: Derived Types</H2>

<H3><a name="7.4">7.4 The Explanation of Numeric Types</a></H3>

The explanation of numeric types is based on the use of derived types.
A type declaration such as
<p>
<PRE>    type REAL is digits 8 range -1.0E30 .. 1.0E30;</PRE>
<p>
is explained  as being  equivalent  to  the  following  succession  of
declarations
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type hidden_real is new predefined_floating_point_type;
subtype REAL is hidden_real digits 8 range   hidden_real (-1.0E30) .. hidden_real (1.0E30);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This means  that REAL  is a  subtype of a type hidden_real obtained by
copying a  predefined floating  point  type.  The  selection  of  this
predefined type  is done by the compiler; the type chosen must support
the precision  required -  here  it  must  have  at  least  8  digits;
furthermore it must support at least the range required. The fact that
this selection  is performed  by the compiler ensures portability: the
programmer need not know which floating point type is actually used.
<p>
The role  played by  derivation in  this explanation  is to  provide a
distinct replica of the floating point type. Thus if we write
<p>
<PRE>    type MY_REAL is digits 8;</PRE>
<p>
we are  sure of getting a new type. In particular this means that REAL
and MY_REAL are distinct types.
<p>
The reason  to consider  REAL as  a subtype of hidden_real is that for
operations on values of this type, the compiler may generate code that
corresponds to  one of the hardware floating point types: range checks
are  used   for  assignments  but  not  for  intermediate  results  in
expressions.
