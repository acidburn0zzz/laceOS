<P>
Values input from the external environment of the program, or output to the
environment, are considered to occupy external files.  An external file can
be  anything external to the program that can produce a value to be read or
receive a value to be written.  An external file is identified by a  string
(the  name).   A  second  string  (the form) gives further system-dependent
characteristics that may be associated with the file, such as the  physical
organization   or   access   rights.    The   conventions   governing   the
interpretation of such strings must be documented in <a href="lrm-F.html#F">Appendix F</a>. 
<P>
Input and output operations are expressed as operations on objects of  some
file  type,  rather  than  directly in terms of the external files.  In the
remainder of this chapter, the term file is always used to refer to a  file
object;   the term external file is used otherwise.  The values transferred
for a given file must all be of one type. 
<P>
Input-output for sequential files of values of a  single  element  type  is
defined  by  means  of  the generic package SEQUENTIAL_IO.  The skeleton of
this package is given below. 
<pre>
    with IO_EXCEPTIONS;
    generic   
       type ELEMENT_TYPE is private;
    package SEQUENTIAL_IO is
       type FILE_TYPE is limited private; 

       type FILE_MODE is (IN_FILE, OUT_FILE);
       ...
       procedure OPEN (FILE : in out FILE_TYPE; ...);
       ...  
       procedure READ (FILE : in FILE_TYPE; ITEM : out ELEMENT_TYPE);
       procedure WRITE(FILE : in FILE_TYPE; ITEM : in ELEMENT_TYPE);
       ...
    end SEQUENTIAL_IO; 
</pre>
<P>
In order to define sequential input-output for a  given  element  type,  an
instantiation  of  this  generic  unit,  with  the  given  type  as  actual
parameter,  must  be  declared.   The  resulting   package   contains   the
declaration  of  a file type (called FILE_TYPE) for files of such elements,
as well as the operations applicable to these  files,  such  as  the  OPEN,
READ, and WRITE procedures.                                                           
<P>
Input-output  for  direct  access  files  is  likewise defined by a generic
package called DIRECT_IO.  Input-output in human-readable form  is  defined
by the (nongeneric) package TEXT_IO. 
<P>
Before input or output operations can be performed on a file, the file must
first be associated with an external file.  While such an association is in
effect,  the  file is said to be open, and otherwise the file is said to be
closed. 
<P>
The language does not define what  happens  to  external  files  after  the
completion  of the main program (in particular, if corresponding files have
not  been  closed).   The  effect  of  input-output  for  access  types  is
implementation-dependent. 
<P>
An open file has a current mode, which is a value of one of the enumeration
types   
<pre>
 type FILE_MODE is (IN_FILE, INOUT_FILE, OUT_FILE);  --  for DIRECT_IO
 type FILE_MODE is (IN_FILE, OUT_FILE);    --  for SEQUENTIAL_IO and TEXT_IO
</pre>
<P>
These  values correspond respectively to the cases where only reading, both
reading and writing, or only writing are to be performed.  The  mode  of  a
file can be changed. 
<P>
Several  file  management  operations  are common to the three input-output
packages.  These operations are described in section <a href="lrm-14-02.html#14.2.1">14.2.1</a> for  sequential
and  direct files.  Any additional effects concerning text input-output are
described in section <a href="lrm-14-03.html#14.3.1">14.3.1</a>. 
<P>
The exceptions that can be raised by a call of an  input-output  subprogram
are  all  defined  in  the  package IO_EXCEPTIONS;  the situations in which
they can be raised are described, either following the description  of  the
subprogram  (and  in  section  <a href="lrm-14-04.html#14.4">14.4</a>), or in <a href="lrm-F.html#F">Appendix F</a> in the case of error
situations that are implementation-dependent. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
Each instantiation of the  generic  packages  SEQUENTIAL_IO  and  DIRECT_IO
declares  a  different  type  FILE_TYPE;   in the case of TEXT_IO, the type
FILE_TYPE is unique. 
<P>
A bidirectional device  can  often  be  modeled  as  two  sequential  files
associated  with the device, one of mode IN_FILE, and one of mode OUT_FILE.
An implementation may restrict the number of files that may  be  associated
with a given external file.  The effect of sharing an external file in this
way by several file objects is implementation-dependent.
