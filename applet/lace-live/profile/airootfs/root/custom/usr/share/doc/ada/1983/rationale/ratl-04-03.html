<H2>CHAPTER 4: Types</H2>

<H3><a name="4.3">4.3 Type Equivalence</a></H3>

As stated  before, one  of the  objectives of  a  type  system  is  to
disallow incorrect  (in particular unintentional) mixing of objects of
different types.  Hence a  key issue in the design of a type system is
the formulation  of the  conditions that  must  be  satisfied  by  two
objects in order that they have the same type.
<p>
Alternative resolutions  of this  issue of  type equivalence have been
put forward in a paper by Welsh, Sneeringer, and Hoare <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[WSH 77]</a>. These
are  classified   into  two  families,  called  name  equivalence  and
structural equivalence.
<p>
Name equivalence  is used  in Ada.  It is  based on the principle that
each type  declaration  declares  a  distinct  type:  hence  two  type
declarations always  declare two  distinct types, even if the included
type  definitions  are  textually  identical.  Consequently,  for  two
objects to  have the  same type,  their declarations must refer to the
same type  name (whether  directly, or  indirectly by a subtype, as we
shall see later).
<p>
Consider for example the declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type COLOR is (WHITE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, BROWN, BLACK);
type COLOUR is (WHITE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, BROWN, BLACK);

TINT      :  COLOR :=  BROWN;
SHADE     :  COLOR :=  RED;
HUE, SPOT :  COLOUR   :=  GREEN;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Then, according  to the  above stated  principle, COLOR and COLOUR are
two distinct  types; TINT  and SHADE are of the same type (COLOR); HUE
and SPOT are of the same type (COLOUR). Thus the following assignments
are legal:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TINT  :=  SHADE;
SPOT  :=  HUE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On the  other hand,  SPOT and TINT are of different types, so that the
following assignment is not allowed:
<p>
<PRE>    SPOT  :=  TINT;        -- Illegal!
</PRE><p>
Structural equivalence  refers to  formulations in  which some form of
equivalence rule  is defined  between types  on  the  basis  of  their
structural  properties.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  enumeration
literals  several   degrees  of   structural  equivalence   would   be
conceivable:  the   same  number  of  literals  (unlikely);  the  same
literals, although  not  necessarily  in  the  same  order;  textually
identical, including  spaces and  line breaks  and so  on. For example
COLOR and  COLOUR would  be considered  as structurally equivalent for
all but the last of these formulations.
<p>
We have  rejected structural  equivalence in  order to  avoid pattern-
matching problems  for the  compiler and  for the human reader: in the
case of enumeration types, this could involve comparisons of very long
lists of identifiers.
<p>
We also  believe that  structural  equivalence  tends  to  defeat  the
purpose of  typing. Thus,  objects could be considered as being of the
same type  because their  structures  happen  to  be  identical  -  by
accident -  or because  they have  become identical  as  a  result  of
textual modifications  performed during  program maintenance:  in  the
case of enumeration types, after deleting or inserting a literal. Such
objects could  then be mixed unintentionally, without causing compiler
diagnostics, and the error would go undetected.
<p>
Name equivalence  is therefore  both simpler  and safer.  If  we  want
several objects  to have the same type, then we must declare the type,
thereby giving  it a name, and we must subsequently refer to this name
in the declarations of these objects.
<p>
Further arguments  supporting name  equivalence are  presented in  the
sections concerning arrays (see <a href="ratl-04-05.html#4.5.3">4.5.3</a>) and records (see <a href="ratl-04-06.html#4.6.1">4.6.1</a>).
