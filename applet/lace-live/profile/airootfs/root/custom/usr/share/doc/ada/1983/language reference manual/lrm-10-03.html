<H2><A NAME="10.3">10.3</A>.  Order of Compilation  </H2>

<P>
The  rules  defining  the  order  in which units can be compiled are direct 
consequences of the visibility rules and, in particular, of the  fact  that
any  library  unit that is mentioned by the context clause of a compilation
unit is visible in the compilation unit. 
<P>
A compilation unit must be compiled after all library units  named  by  its
context clause.  A secondary unit that is a subprogram or package body must
be  compiled after the corresponding library unit.  Any subunit of a parent
compilation unit must be compiled after the parent compilation unit. 
<P>
If any error is detected while attempting to compile  a  compilation  unit,
then  the attempted compilation is rejected and it has no effect whatsoever
on the program library;  the same holds for recompilations (no  compilation
unit can become obsolete because of such a recompilation). 
<P>
The  order in which the compilation units of a program are compiled must be
consistent with the partial ordering defined by the above rules. 
<P>
Similar rules apply for recompilations.  A compilation unit is  potentially
affected  by  a  change in any library unit named by its context clause.  A
secondary unit is potentially affected by a  change  in  the  corresponding
library  unit.   The  subunits of a parent compilation unit are potentially  
affected by a change of the parent compilation unit.  If a compilation unit
is successfully recompiled, the compilation units potentially  affected  by
this  change  are obsolete and must be recompiled unless they are no longer
needed.  An implementation may be able to reduce the compilation  costs  if
it  can deduce that some of the potentially affected units are not actually
affected by the change.                                                   
<P>
The subunits of a unit can be recompiled without affecting the unit itself.
Similarly, changes in a subprogram or package  body  do  not  affect  other
compilation  units  (apart  from  the  subunits  of  the  body) since these
compilation  units  only  have  access  to  the   subprogram   or   package
specification.  An implementation is only allowed to deviate from this rule
for  inline inclusions, for certain compiler optimizations, and for certain
implementations of generic program units, as described below. 
<ul>
<li>If a pragma INLINE is applied to a subprogram declaration given  in  a
package  specification,  inline inclusion will only be achieved if the
package body is compiled before units calling the subprogram.  In such
a case, inline inclusion creates a dependence of the calling  unit  on
the  package  body,  and  the compiler  must recognize this dependence
when deciding on the need for recompilation.  If  a  calling  unit  is
compiled  before  the  package  body, the pragma may be ignored by the
compiler for such calls (a  warning  that  inline  inclusion  was  not
achieved may be issued).  Similar considerations apply to a separately
compiled subprogram for which an INLINE pragma is specified.<br><br> 
<li>For optimization purposes, an implementation may compile several units
of a given compilation in a way that creates further dependences among
these   compilation   units.    The  compiler  must  then  take  these
dependences into account when deciding on the need for recompilations.<br><br> 
<li>An implementation may require  that  a  generic  declaration  and  the
corresponding proper body be part of the same compilation, whether the
generic  unit  is  itself  separately  compiled or is local to another
compilation unit.  An implementation may also require that subunits of 
a generic unit be part of the same compilation. 
</ul>
<P>
Examples of Compilation Order: 
<ol>
<li>In example 1 (see <a href="lrm-10-01.html#10.1.1">10.1.1</a>):  The procedure QUADRATIC_EQUATION  must  be
compiled after the library packages TEXT_IO  and REAL_OPERATIONS since
they appear in its with clause.<br><br>
<li>In example 2 (see <a href="lrm-10-01.html#10.1.2">10.1.2</a>):  The package body STOCK  must  be  compiled
after the corresponding package specification.<br><br> 
<li>In example 2 (see <a href="lrm-10-01.html#10.1.2">10.1.2</a>):  The specification  of  the  package  STOCK
must  be  compiled before the procedure PROCESSOR.  On the other hand,
the procedure PROCESSOR can be compiled either  before  or  after  the
package body STOCK.<br><br> 
<li>In example 3 (see <a href="lrm-10-02.html#10.2.1">10.2.1</a>):  The procedure G must be compiled after the
package  TEXT_IO  since this package is named by the with clause of G.
On the other hand, TEXT_IO can be compiled either before or after TOP. 
<br><br>
<li>In example 3 (see <a href="lrm-10-02.html#10.2.1">10.2.1</a>):  The subunits TRANSFORM and  FACILITY  must
be compiled after the main program TOP.  Similarly, the subunit G must
be compiled after its parent unit FACILITY. 
</ol>
Notes:    
<P>
For  library  packages,  it  follows  from  the  recompilation rules that a
package body is made obsolete by the  recompilation  of  the  corresponding
specification.   If  the  new  package specification is such that a package
body is not required (that  is,  if  the  package  specification  does  not
contain  the  declaration  of  a program unit), then the recompilation of a
body for this package is not required.  In any case, the  obsolete  package
body  must  not  be  used  and  can  therefore  be deleted from the program
library.
