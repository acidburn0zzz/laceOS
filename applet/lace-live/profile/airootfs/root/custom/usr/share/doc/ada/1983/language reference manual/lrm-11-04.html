<P>
When  an  exception  is  raised,  normal program execution is abandoned and  
control is transferred to an exception  handler.   The  selection  of  this
handler  depends on whether the exception is raised during the execution of
statements or during the elaboration of declarations.

<P>
The  handling  of  an  exception  raised  by the execution of a sequence of
statements depends on whether the innermost frame or accept statement  that
encloses the sequence of statements is a frame or an accept statement.  The
case  where  an accept statement is innermost is described in section <a href="lrm-11-05.html#11.5">11.5</a>.
The case where a frame is innermost is presented here.                                                    
<P>
Different actions take place, depending on whether or not this frame has  a
handler  for  the  exception, and on whether the exception is raised in the
sequence of statements of the frame or in that of an exception handler. 
<P>
If an exception is raised in the sequence of statements of a frame that has
a handler for the exception, execution of the sequence of statements of the
frame is abandoned and control is transferred  to  the  exception  handler.
The  execution  of  the sequence of statements of the handler completes the
execution of the frame (or its elaboration if the frame is a package body). 
<P>
If an exception is raised in the sequence of statements  of  a  frame  that
does  not  have  a handler for the exception, execution of this sequence of 
statements is abandoned.  The next action depends  on  the  nature  of  the
frame: 
<ol>
<li>For a subprogram body, the same exception is raised again at the point
of  call  of the subprogram, unless the subprogram is the main program
itself, in which case execution of the main program is abandoned. 
<br><br>
<li>For a block statement, the same exception is raised again  immediately
after  the  block  statement  (that is, within the innermost enclosing
frame or accept statement).<br><br> 
<li>For a package body that is a declarative item, the same  exception  is
raised  again  immediately  after  this  declarative  item (within the
enclosing declarative part). If the package body is that of a subunit,
the exception is raised again at the place of the  corresponding  body
stub.  If the package is a library unit, execution of the main program
is abandoned.<br><br> 
<li>For a task body, the task becomes completed. 
</ol>
An exception that is raised again (as in the above cases (a), (b), and (c))
is  said  to  be propagated, either by the execution of the subprogram, the
execution of the block statement, or the elaboration of the  package  body.
No  propagation  takes place in the case of a task body.  If the frame is a
subprogram or a  block  statement  and  if  it  has  dependent  tasks,  the
propagation  of  an  exception  takes  place  only after termination of the
dependent tasks. 
<P>
Finally, if an exception is raised in the  sequence  of  statements  of  an
exception  handler,  execution of this sequence of statements is abandoned.
Subsequent actions (including propagation, if any) are as in the cases  (a)
to (d) above, depending on the nature of the frame. 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    function FACTORIAL (N : POSITIVE) return FLOAT is
    begin
       if N = 1 then
          return 1.0;
       else
          return FLOAT(N) * FACTORIAL(N-1);
       end if;
    exception   
       when NUMERIC_ERROR =&gt; return FLOAT'SAFE_LARGE;
    end FACTORIAL; 
</pre>
<P>
If  the  multiplication  raises  NUMERIC_ERROR,  then  FLOAT'SAFE_LARGE  is
returned by the handler.   This  value  will  cause  further  NUMERIC_ERROR
exceptions  to be raised by the evaluation of the expression in each of the
remaining invocations of the function, so that for large values  of  N  the
function will ultimately return the value FLOAT'SAFE_LARGE.                                                 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    procedure P is
       ERROR : exception;
       procedure R; 

       procedure Q is
       begin
          R;
          ...            --  error situation (2)
       exception
          ...
          when ERROR =&gt;  --  handler E2
          ...
       end Q; 

       procedure R is
       begin
          ...            --  error situation (3)
       end R; 

    begin
       ...               --  error situation (1)
       Q;
       ...
    exception
       ...
       when ERROR =&gt;     --  handler E1
       ...
    end P; 
</pre>
<P>
The following situations can arise: 
<ul>
<li> (1)<br>  
If the exception ERROR is raised in the sequence of statements of  the
outer  procedure  P,  the  handler  E1  provided  within  P is used to
complete the execution of P.<br><br> 
<li> (2)<br>
If the exception ERROR is raised in the sequence of statements  of  Q,
the  handler E2 provided within Q is used to complete the execution of
Q.  Control will be returned to the point of call of Q upon completion
of the handler.<br><br>
<li> (3)<br>
If the exception ERROR is raised in the body of R, called  by  Q,  the  
execution  of  R  is abandoned and the same exception is raised in the
body of Q.  The handler E2 is then used to complete the  execution  of
Q, as in situation (2). 
</ul>
<P>
Note  that  in  the  third  situation, the exception raised in R results in
(indirectly) transferring control to a handler that is part of Q and  hence
not  enclosed by R.  Note also that if a handler were provided within R for
the exception choice others, situation (3) would cause  execution  of  this
handler, rather than direct termination of R.    
<P>
Lastly,  if ERROR had been declared in R, rather than in P, the handlers E1
and E2  could  not  provide  an  explicit  handler  for  ERROR  since  this
identifier would not be visible within the bodies of P and Q.  In situation
(3), the exception could however be handled in Q by providing a handler for
the exception choice others.                                                    
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The  language  does  not define what happens when the execution of the main
program is abandoned after an unhandled exception. 
<P>
The predefined exceptions are those that can be  propagated  by  the  basic
operations and the predefined operators. 
<P>
The  case of a frame that is a generic unit is already covered by the rules
for subprogram and package bodies, since the sequence of statements of such
a frame is not executed but is the template for the corresponding sequences
of  statements  of  the  subprograms  or  packages  obtained   by   generic
instantiation.

<P>
If an exception is raised during the elaboration of the declarative part of
a given frame, this elaboration is abandoned.  The next action  depends  on
the nature of the frame: 
<ol>
<li>For a subprogram body, the same exception is raised again at the point
of  call  of the subprogram, unless the subprogram is the main program
itself, in which case execution of the main program is abandoned.<br><br> 
<li>For a block statement, the same exception is raised again  immediately
after the block statement. <br><br>
<li>For a package body that is a declarative item, the same  exception  is
raised again immediately after this declarative item, in the enclosing
declarative  part.   If  the  package  body  is that of a subunit, the
exception is raised again at the place of the corresponding body stub.
If the package is a library unit, execution of  the  main  program  is
abandoned.<br><br> 
<li>For a task  body,  the  task  becomes  completed,  and  the  exception
TASKING_ERROR  is  raised  at  the point of activation of the task, as
explained in section <a href="lrm-09-03.html#9.3">9.3</a>.<br><br> 
Similarly, if an exception is raised during the  elaboration  of  either  a
package  declaration  or a task declaration, this elaboration is abandoned;
the next action depends on the nature of the declaration.   
<li>For a package declaration or a task declaration, that is a declarative
item, the exception is raised again immediately after the  declarative
item  in the enclosing declarative part or package specification.  For
the declaration of a  library  package,  the  execution  of  the  main
program is abandoned. 
</ol>
An  exception that is raised again (as in the above cases (a), (b), (c) and
(e)) is said to be propagated, either by the execution of the subprogram or
block statement, or by the elaboration of  the  package  declaration,  task
declaration or package body.                                                           
<P>
Example  of an exception in the declarative part of a block statement (case (b)): 
<pre>
    procedure P is
       ...
    begin
       declare
          N : INTEGER := F;  --  the function F may raise ERROR
       begin
          ...
       exception
          when ERROR =&gt;      --  handler E1
       end;
       ...
    exception
       when ERROR =&gt;         --  handler E2
    end P; 

    --  if the exception ERROR is raised in the declaration of N, it is handled by E2
