<H1>Foreword to this version of the Ada Reference Manual</H1>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.1">0.1/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Standard for the programming 
language Ada is ISO/IEC 8652:<span class="insert4">2012</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;1995</span>(E).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.2">0.2/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada Working Group ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 9 
is tasked by ISO with the work item to interpret and maintain the International 
Standard and to produce Technical Corrigenda, as appropriate. The technical 
work on the International Standard is performed by the Ada Rapporteur 
Group (ARG) of WG 9. In <span class="insert4">June 2015</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;September 
2000</span>, WG 9 approved and forwarded Technical Corrigendum 1 to SC 
22 for ISO approval, which was granted in <span class="insert4">December 
2015</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;February 2001</span>. Technical Corrigendum 
1 was published in <span class="insert4">February 2016</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;June 
2001</span>.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.3">0.3/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="insert4"></span><span class="delete4">In 
October 2002, WG 9 approved a schedule and guidelines for the preparation 
of an Amendment to the International Standard. WG 9 approved the scope 
of the Amendment in June 2004. In April 2006, WG 9 approved and forwarded 
the Amendment to SC 22 for approval, which was granted in August 2006. 
Final ISO/IEC approval came in January 2007, and the Amendment was published 
as ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007(E) in March 2007.</span></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.4">0.4/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Corrigendum lists the individual 
changes that need to be made to the text of the International Standard 
to correct errors, omissions or inconsistencies. The corrections specified 
in Technical Corrigendum 1 are part of the International Standard ISO/IEC 
8652:<span class="insert4">2012</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;1995</span>(E).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.5">0.5/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="delete4">Similarly, Amendment 1 and 
Amendment 2 list the individual changes that need to be made to the text 
of the International Standard to add new features as well as correct 
errors.</span></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.6">0.6/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;When ISO published Technical Corrigendum 1, it 
did not also publish a document that merges the changes from the Technical 
Corrigendum into the text of the International Standard.<span class="delete4">&nbsp;Similarly, ISO did not publish a document that merges the changes from 
Technical Corrigendum and Amendment 1 into the text of the International 
Standard. It is not known whether ISO will publish a document that merges 
the changes from Technical Corrigendum 1, Amendment 1, and Amendment 
2 into the text of the International Standard.</span> However, ISO rules 
require that the project editor for the International Standard be able 
to produce such a document on demand.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.7">0.7/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of the Ada Reference Manual is what 
the project editor would provide to ISO in response to such a request. 
It incorporates the changes specified in the Technical Corrigendum <span class="insert4"></span><span class="delete4">and 
Amendments 1 and 2&nbsp;</span>into the text of <span class="insert4">ISO/IEC 
8652:2012(E)</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E)</span>. 
It should be understood that the publication of any ISO document involves 
changes in general format, boilerplate, headers, etc., as well as a review 
by professional editors that may introduce editorial changes to the text. 
This version of the Ada Reference Manual is therefore neither an official 
ISO document, nor a version guaranteed to be identical to an official 
ISO document, should ISO decide to reprint the International Standard 
incorporating an approved Technical Corrigendum<span class="insert4"></span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;and Amendments</span>. It is nevertheless a best effort to be as close 
as possible to the technical content of such an updated document. In 
the case of a conflict between this document and <span class="insert4">Technical 
Corrigendum 1 as approved by ISO (or between this document and&nbsp;</span><span class="delete4">Amendment 
2 as approved by ISO (or between this document and Amendment 1 in the 
case of paragraphs not changed by Amendment 2; or between this document 
and Technical Corrigendum 1 in the case of paragraphs not changed by 
either Amendment; or between this document and&nbsp;</span>the original 8652:<span class="insert4">2012</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;1995</span> 
in the case of paragraphs not changed by <span class="delete4">either 
Amendment or&nbsp;</span>Technical Corrigendum 1), the other documents contain 
the official text of the International Standard <span class="insert4">ISO/IEC 
8652:2012(E)</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E) and its 
Amendments</span>.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p0.8">0.8/4</a></div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is very inconvenient to have the Reference 
Manual for Ada specified in <span class="insert4">two</span><span class="delete4">&nbsp;four</span> 
documents, this consolidated version of the Ada Reference Manual is made 
available to the public.</div>
