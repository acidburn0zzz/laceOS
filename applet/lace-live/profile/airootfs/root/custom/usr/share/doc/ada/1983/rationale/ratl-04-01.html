<H2>CHAPTER 4: Types</H2>

<H3><a name="4.1">4.1 Introduction</a></H3>

The notion of type has gradually emerged from the past twenty years of
the history  of programming  languages as  the way  by which we impose
structure on  data. A now widely accepted view of types is that a type
characterizes the  set of  values that objects of the type may assume,
and the  set of  operations that may be performed on them. This common
view is also taken in the Ada language.
<p>
There are  several important  reasons why  it is  found  desirable  to
associate a type with constants and variables:
<DL>
<DT><b>Factorization of Properties, Maintainability</b>
<DD>Knowledge about  common properties  of objects  should be described
   and collected  in one  place and  a name  should be associated with
   that  description.   A  type   declaration  serves   that  purpose.
   Subsequently, the  type name  may be  used to  refer to  the common
   properties in  object  declarations.  This  factorization  improves
   program maintainability:  if  later  a  given  property  is  to  be
   changed, then  the type  declaration will  be the  only part of the
   program text to be affected by the change.
<p>
<DT><b>Reliability</b>
<DD>Objects with distinct properties should be clearly distinguished in
   a program,  and the distinction should be enforced by the compiler.
   Requiring that  all objects  be typed  thus contributes  to program
   reliability. Experience  has shown  that a  well-written program in
   Pascal can  be recognized  easily by  the use  made of  the  typing
   facility to  increase the reliability, readability, and security of
   the program.
<p>
<DT><b>Abstraction, Hiding of Implementation Details</b>
<DD>Abstract or external properties of objects and operations should be
   separated from  underlying  and  internal  implementation-dependent
   properties, such  as the  physical  representation  on  a  specific
   machine. The  abstract properties  of an  object are  the only ones
   that need  to be  known for  its use. Implementation details should
   therefore be  hidden from  the user. The need for such a separation
   is particularly  strong in  the case  of  disjoint  sections  of  a
   program text, produced and maintained by different programmers, and
   presumably separately compiled.
</DL>

Several classical  problems are  associated with  the formulation of a
type facility  in a  programming language.  Some are  the  subject  of
ongoing debate among language designers and users, in particular:
<DL>
<DT><b>(a)              Static versus Dynamic Properties</b>
<DD>Should both  the static  properties -  those which are determinable
   from an  analysis of the program text at compilation time - and the
   dynamic  properties  -  those  which  may  depend  on  the  dynamic
   execution of  a program,  such as reading from an input device - be
   covered by a single notion of type?
<p>
<DT><b>(b)              Type Equivalence</b>
<DD>Should  the   language  provide   some  form   of  equivalence   or
   compatibility among types with logically related properties?
<p>
<DT><b>(c)              Parameterization</b>
<DD>Should the language provide some form of parameterization for types
   and their  associated properties?  Should the  evaluation  of  type
   parameters be  performed  at  translation  time  or  should  it  be
   deferred until execution time?
</DL>

The Ada solutions to the above problems are now summarized. A detailed
discussion of  these design  decisions is  given in  later sections of
this chapter.
<DL>
<DT><b>(a)              Static versus Dynamic Properties</b>
<p>
<DD>Two notions are distinguished: the notion of type and the notion of
   subtype. A  type characterizes  a distinct  set of  values and  its
   static properties, such as the applicable operations.
<p>
   Constraints may  be imposed  on named  types: for  example a  range
   constraint for  a scalar  type, or an index constraint for an array
   type. In  general, constraints  define certain  requirements  whose
   satisfaction is to be checked dynamically. A subtype name serves as
   an  abbreviation  for  a  type  name  together  with  a  constraint
   associated with  the type.  Several difficulties  in the  types  of
   Pascal that  have been  noted by  Habermann and others [Hab 73, WSH
   77] are overcome in Ada by the notion of subtype.
<p>
<DT><b>(b)              Type Equivalence</b>
<p>
<DD>Each type declaration defines a distinct type. In consequence, each
   type name  denotes a  distinct type.  Values of a given type can be
   assigned only  to objects  that have this type. Values of different
   types cannot be intermixed.
<p>
   In contrast,  objects that have different subtypes of the same type
   are compatible:  the value  of an  object  may  be  assigned  to  a
   variable that  has the same type, whether or not the object and the
   variable have the same subtype. Constraints are normally checked at
   execution time,  although in many cases these checks can be done at
   compilation time, in anticipation.
<p>
   Certain explicit  conversions are  allowed between  closely related
   types. Such  explicit conversions  are defined among numeric types,
   among sufficiently  similar array types, and among derived types of
   the same family. Being explicit, these conversions are safe. On the
   other hand,  no implicit  conversion is possible among user-defined
   types.
<p>
<DT><b>(c)              Parameterization</b>
<p>
<DD>Parameterization at  execution time  is closely associated with the
   notion of  constraint. In  particular this  applies  to  array  and
   record types:
<p>
<UL type=disc>
<li>An unconstrained  array  type  declaration  has  unspecified  index
   bounds. These are subsequently specified by an index constraint for
   a given  array object  so that  different array objects of the same
   type may  have different numbers of components. If such an array is
   a formal  parameter of  a subprogram,  its bounds are obtained from
   the actual parameter for each call.
<p>
<li>A  record  type  may  have  special  components  which  are  called
   discriminants and  whose values  are  used  at  execution  time  to
   discriminate among  alternative variants  of the  record type.  For
   example, the  value of  a discriminant  may be  used to determine a
   bound of a record component that is itself an array. It is possible
   to constrain  a record  by a discriminant constraint, which imposes
   (and establishes)  certain values  for the discriminants. As in the
   case of  arrays, it  is possible  to write  subprograms of  general
   utility  which  operate  on  records  with  arbitrary  discriminant
   values.
</UL>
<p>
   Parameterization at  compilation  time  is  achieved  by  the  very
   powerful mechanism  of generic  units. Whereas  parameterization at
   execution time  by index  bounds and  discriminants is  limited  to
   scalar  values,  the  parameters  of  generic  units  can  even  be
   subprograms and  types. For example, we could model the length of a
   stack by  a discriminant;  but, to  allow for  different  types  of
   elements, we  would need  to define stacks within a generic package
   and have  the element  type be  a generic  parameter. We could then
   create several  instances of  the generic  package, for example one
   for stacks of integers, one for stacks of characters, and so on.
</DL>

These solutions are detailed in the following sections of this chapter
(and, in  the case  of <a href="ratl-12.html#12">generic  units</a>, in  a later  chapter). We first
introduce the  concept of  type  by  means  of  the  simplest  form  -
enumeration types  - and further use these types for the discussion of
type equivalence and the concepts of constraints and subtypes. We then
proceed  to   a  discussion   of  array   types,  record   types,  and
discriminants; and the general problems of type composition.
