<H2>CHAPTER 10: Separate Compilation and Libraries</H2>

<H3><a name="10.6">10.6 Summary and Conclusion</a></H3>

To summarize the Ada separate compilation facility:
<ul>
<li>The compilation  units of a program form a program library. Library
   units can  be declarations  of  packages,  subprograms  or  generic
   units, or  generic instantiations.  The bodies of library units are
   separately compiled secondary units.
<p>
<li>Subunits of other compilation units can be defined by means of body
   stubs. These subunits are separately compiled.
<p>
<li>The visibility  rules applicable to compilation units are the usual
   visibility rules,  as complemented  by with  clauses. The  order of
   compilation and recompilation is governed by these rules.
</ul>

Separate compilation  has been  designed as  a user-oriented  facility
that supports  the traditional forms of program development. It can be
implemented at  reasonable cost, as evidenced by the previous sections
and by  previous languages  supporting a  similar separate compilation
facility such  as <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis</a>  and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Mesa</a>.  The type  rules are  enforced across
separate units  to the  same degree  as within  a given  unit, and the
information contained  in a  program library can be used to check that
the compilation  of a  given unit  does not use information from other
units that have become obsolete in the meantime.
<p>
Finally, one  of  the  motivations  of  separate  compilation  is  the
creation of  software libraries.  This is supported by Ada. By far the
most useful library units should be packages and generic packages. Ada
permits their  use with  the same  degree of  safety as  for  internal
units.
<p>
It  is   expected  that   library  packages   will  be  used  for  the
encapsulation of  type definitions, for common constants and data, and
for shared declarations. The fact that these library items are already
compiled program  units, rather  than source texts, offers a degree of
safety  not   found  in  languages  that  provide  merely  independent
compilations.
<p>
Other compilation units will be used for the creation of user packages
such as  input-output packages,  to be found in libraries. The ability
to compile  a package  specification separately from the corresponding
package body provides the possibility of separating the interface of a
package from  its implementation.  Thus it supports information hiding
and reliability to an extremely high degree.
