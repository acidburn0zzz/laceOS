<H3><BR><a name="9.3.1">9.3.1 Visibility Control and Information Hiding</a></H3>

The visibility  rules of  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 60</a>, as embodied in its so-called block
structure, are  quite natural  for programs  of moderate size and have
been  adopted   by  most  subsequent  languages,  including  Ada:  any
declaration is  visible throughout  the block  for which  it is given,
including nested  inner blocks, unless hidden by declarations local to
those blocks.  However this  simple structure  is insufficient for the
reliable construction  of large  programs since  more precise  control
over the  visibility of declarations is then needed. For example, with
the above rule, a variable that is used by several subprograms must be
declared outside  their bodies,  although it has no relevance to other
parts of  the program. This variable will then be visible to all users
of these  subprograms, and  unprotected from  accidental or  malicious
access.
<p>
Packages give the programmer precisely the kind of control needed. The
details of the visibility rules are discussed in <a href="ratl-11.html#11">chapter 11</a> on program
structure; in  this chapter we concentrate on characteristics that are
essential for visibility control and information hiding.
<p>
In the  definition  of  a  package,  the  visible  part  states  which
declarations  are  potentially  visible  outside  the  package.  (This
identifies the window in the above-mentioned wall.) It is possible for
other program  units to  see whatever is in the visible part; but they
do  not  see  it  automatically.  Within  these  program  units,  this
visibility is  achieved either  by use  clauses or  by expanded  names
written in the form known as dot notation.
<p>
Thus visibility  of the  identifiers declared  in the  visible part is
controlled by  the user.  Names declared  in the  visible  part  of  a
package do  not spontaneously  invade (and  pollute) the name space of
the rest of the program. Visibility of the identifiers declared in the
package body  is even  more tightly  controlled: they are visible only
within the  package body  - in  particular, within  the  body  of  any
subprogram declared in the visible part.
<p>
The other  essential characteristic  of packages in Ada is the textual
separation of  the interface - those declarations that are relevant to
users of  the package  - from  the implementation.  In an Ada package,
these declarations  are textually separated from the rest of the text:
they form what is called the visible part of the package. This textual
separation  is   a  significant  advantage  for  readability  and  for
information hiding.
<p>
Other languages  such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Euclid</a> and  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula</a> have  used a  formulation
based on  an export list that mentions all identifiers that constitute
the interface.  This means  that in  order to  know the  properties of
these identifiers,  the human reader must scan through the entire text
of the  module to  find the  declarations of  entities listed  in  the
export list.  This is  a tedious  operation and is, as we shall see, a
breach of  information hiding  principles, since  it involves  reading
parts of the text that should be of no concern (and should not even be
available) to the user.
<p>
There are  good reasons for hiding the text of a package body from its
users.  An   obvious  one  is  confidentiality:  a  software  producer
supplying the  services of  a given  package may  want to  protect his
investment by not showing the package implementation (at least, not in
source form).  Another reason  to hide the text of a package body from
its users  is to  establish the  normal producer-consumer  contractual
relationship that  exists for  other commercial  products. It  is  the
package specification  that  should  be  considered  as  the  contract
between  the   producer  and   the  users.   The  included   procedure
specifications already  form a (minimal) syntactic contract, but these
may be  supplemented by  some explanation of their intended effect. In
the present  state of  the art such explanation must perforce take the
form of  comments.  In  the  future,  however,  it  could  consist  of
statements of  some more  formal specification  language such  as Anna
<a href="ratl-BIB.html">[KBL 80]</a>.
<p>
Letting a user read the implementation would create the danger that he
might derive  some additional implicit assumptions from an analysis of
the current  implementation: assumptions  that are not explicit in the
contract. The producer of a package is bound only by the contract, and
is therefore  free to deliver later releases of the package that might
not satisfy any such implicit assumptions of the user.
<p>
The textual  separation between  the  package  specification  and  the
package implementation  provides an easy solution to this problem. The
user  will   be  provided   with  the   source  text  of  the  package
specification, and no more.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.2">9.3.2 Guaranteeing Software Components</a></H3>

In an  industry of  software components,  users are  likely to request
some  guarantee  against  malfunction,  as  is  usual  for  buyers  of
components in  other  industries.  The  problem  of  proving  software
components is certainly not an easy one; but we can show that packages
lead to  a reduction  in its  difficulty. Consider,  for example,  the
above table  management package  and the  steps that  would have to be
taken to  convince oneself  that it  was operating correctly. To begin
with we  have to  define a  consistent  state  for  the  package:  for
example, we  can define  the table to be consistent if it contains all
the items  that have  been inserted  but not  yet retrieved,  and only
these. We  first have  to show that the table is consistent initially:
that is,  after execution  of the  initialization statements.  Then we
have to show that if the table is consistent before the use of any one
of the  services offered (the three procedures promised in the visible
part), it  will still  be  consistent  after  the  execution  of  that
procedure.
<p>
In order  to do  this, our analysis need only consider the text of the
corresponding procedure:  the table  cannot be  updated directly  from
outside the package since it is not visible there.
<p>
Without packages,  the table would have to be global and we would have
no protection against direct update of the table by users (whether the
update is  intentional  or  by  accident).  The  previous  consistency
argument would  then be  considerably more  complex since  it would be
necessary to  inspect the  text of  all programs  that use  any of the
three procedures  and check that these programs do not directly update
the value  of the  table: The amount of text to be checked could be an
order of magnitude larger than the text of the package itself.
<p>
With the  package concept  - with the separation between the interface
and the  implementation; and  with the protection of whatever is local
to the package body - servicing software components becomes similar to
servicing  components  in  other  industries:  If  a  user  reports  a
malfunction of  the operations of a package, we know that we have only
to check  within the package to establish the reality and cause of any
malfunction  (and  to  make  repairs  as  needed).  The  package  body
effectively acts as a sealed container.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.3">9.3.3 Influence of Separate Compilation on the Design of Packages</a></H3>

The essential role of packages is for logical modularity. In addition,
they also  play an  important role for the physical modularity that is
achieved  by  separate  compilation.  These  two  aspects  of  program
modularization lead  to slightly  different (although not conflicting)
requirements.
<p>
For logical  modularity the interface defined by the visible part of a
package  is  sufficient.  This  information  is  needed  for  physical
modularity  too,   but  the   physical  interface  also  requires  the
availability of  the additional  information that  is contained in the
private part.
<p>
This extra  information is  needed by  compilers for  the treatment of
variables that  are declared in one compilation unit but whose type is
a  private   type  declared  in  a  different  compilation  unit.  The
difference essentially  concerns storage  allocation: knowledge of the
amount of storage needed for such variables is necessary for selecting
the machine  instructions used  for operations  on the variables; this
code selection  is not  a decision  that could  be postponed until the
program is complete (that is, until linkage editing time).
<p>
The reasons  for this  are found  in the  architectures of our current
computing machines. These generally provide code abstractions that are
bound at  execution time,  in the  form of  subprograms invoked by the
call instruction. It is therefore possible to defer the binding of the
bodies of  such abstractions  until link time, or even later. However,
current machines  do not  provide  similar  data  abstractions:  every
instruction  that   operates  on   a  datum   must  be  aware  of  its
representation, and that representation must therefore have been bound
at the  moment the  instruction was generated; that is, at compilation
time. A  more flexible  architecture -  evolved perhaps  from  today's
tagged architectures  - would indeed allow data representation choices
to be deferred until link time, or even later.
<p>
The declaration of a private type therefore does not in itself provide
enough information  for storage  allocation and  other operations. The
full declaration  of the  type is needed, and so is any representation
clause that  the user wants: storage allocation will therefore require
the information  provided by  the private part. Note that placing this
information in  the package  body would  not be  satisfactory since it
would create  unnecessary dependences  of other  compilation units  on
this body,  with  the  consequence  that  changes  in  the  algorithms
provided in  the body  would  require  recompilation  of  these  other
compilation units,  even in  the absence  of change  to the  full type
declaration.
<p>
The one  case where full type information can indeed be deferred until
the package  body is the case where the private type is implemented as
an access type:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package MINIMAL is
  type OPAQUE is private;
private
  type HIDDEN;                     -- nothing more required
  type OPAQUE is access HIDDEN;
end MINIMAL;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In the  above example,  the full  definition of  HIDDEN can  indeed be
deferred until the package body. The reason, of course, is that nearly
all current  machines have  a uniform addressing structure, so that an
access  value   always  looks  the  same  regardless  of  what  it  is
designating.  (The   language  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula-2</a>   provides  opaque   types  in
essentially the form of this example.)
<p>
To summarize,  the logical  interface corresponds to the visible part;
the  physical   interface  corresponds   to   the   complete   package
specification, that is, to both the visible part and the private part.
<p>
As long  as a  package specification  is not changed, the package body
that implements  it can  be defined  and redefined  without  affecting
other units  that use  this  specification  as  an  interface  to  the
package. Hence  it is  possible to  compile a  package body separately
from its package specification.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.4">9.3.4 Initialization of Packages</a></H3>

Each package  declaration results in a single package which is created
when the declaration is elaborated. At that time, the space needed for
any  object   declared  in   the  package   is  allocated,   and   any
initialization specified in such an object declaration is performed.
<p>
More elaborate  initializations can  be included  in the  sequence  of
statements following the (optional) reserved word begin in the package
body, in  particular, initializations  that require  the execution  of
statements and  not  just  expressions  in  object  declarations.  The
execution of  this (optional)  sequence of  statements  completes  the
elaboration of  the package. Any exception handler provided at the end
of  these   statements  applies  to  exceptions  raised  during  their
execution.
<p>
When several  copies of a given package are needed, the solution is to
use instead  a related  form of  program unit called a generic package
(see <a href="ratl-13.html#13">Chapter  13</a>). In  this case  the specification includes a generic
formal part  and individual  packages (instances  of the generic unit)
are created by generic instantiation.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.5">9.3.5 Note on Visibility</a></H3>

If a  use clause  is provided within a given program unit, it opens up
the visibility  of the  visible part  of each package mentioned by the
clause.     However     this     effect     is     not     transitive.
<p>
Thus, if the clause
<PRE>    use FIRST_LAYER;</PRE>
<p>
is given  in the  visible part  of a package SECOND_LAYER, it does not
mean that units containing the clause
<PRE>    use SECOND_LAYER;</PRE>
<p>
will also  see FIRST_LAYER.  If we  want the  above use clause also to
provide visibility  of certain  entities declared in FIRST_LAYER, then
this can  often be  achieved  explicitly,  by  renaming  declarations.
Consider for example
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package FIRST_LAYER is
  type T is private;
  procedure P(X :  T);
  ...
  E :  exception;
end FIRST_LAYER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Suppose  now   that  the   package  SECOND_LAYER   defines  additional
operations for  the type  T in  terms of  the operations  supplied  by
FIRST_LAYER, and  that we  want to  make T,  P, and E available to all
users of  the package SECOND_LAYER without an explicit use FIRST_LAYER
clause. This can be achieved as follows:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package SECOND_LAYER is
  subtype T is FIRST_LAYER.T;
  procedure P(X :  T) renames FIRST_LAYER.P;
  -- additional operations defined by SECOND_LAYER
  ...
  E :  exception renames FIRST_LAYER.E;
end SECOND_LAYER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  a similar effect can be achieved by making T a derived type
instead of a subtype:
<PRE>    type T is new FIRST_LAYER.T;</PRE>
<p>
This latter  form could  be used  if we  wanted to  prevent operations
defined by  another package  for objects  of type  FIRST_LAYER.T  from
being  used  at  the  same  time  as  those  defined  by  the  package
SECOND_LAYER: the  only operations  that may be applied to the derived
type are  those  inherited  from  FIRST_LAYER  and  those  defined  in
SECOND_LAYER.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.6">9.3.6 Availability of the Properties of Types Defined Within Packages</a></H3>

It is  important to  define which of the properties of a type declared
in the  visible part  of a  package can  be made available outside the
package (for  example, within  another program  unit that mentions the
package in  a use clause). In Ada the answer to this question is quite
simple: the  only available  properties  are  those  declared  in  the
visible part.
<p>
In the  first place,  consider the  declaration of a type other than a
private type, say a record type. If such a declaration is given in the
visible part  of a  package,  then  the  record  type  is  potentially
available -  without  restriction  -  to  outside  program  units.  In
particular,  such   units  can  declare  variables  and  invoke  basic
operations of  this type  (such as component selection and aggregates)
in full knowledge of the data structure specified by the type.
<p>
For a  type declared  as private,  on the other hand, the visible part
provides only  the type name, and the specification of the subprograms
applicable to  objects of  this type  - these  are the only operations
applicable  to   objects  of  the  type,  apart  from  assignment  and
comparison for equality and inequality (which are available unless the
private type  is limited),  and attributes  such as 'SIZE and 'ADDRESS
(which are always available).
<p>
Within a  package body  the characteristics  of  a  private  type  are
available as if the type were not private. For example, if the type is
a record  type, its components can be denoted with the usual syntax of
selected components.  Some precautions  must be  taken when one of the
visible operations  of the  type is  defined in  terms of  an existing
operation with  the same  name. As an example consider the skeleton of
the package KEY_MANAGER given in the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-07-04.html#7.4.2">Reference Manual (section 7.4.2)</a>:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package KEY_MANAGER is
  type KEY is private;
  ...
  function "&lt;" (X,Y :  KEY) return BOOLEAN;
private
  type KEY is new NATURAL;          -- full type definition of KEY
  ...
end;

package body KEY_MANAGER is
  ...
  function "&lt;" (X,Y :  KEY) return BOOLEAN is
  begin
    return INTEGER(X) &lt; INTEGER(Y);
  end "&lt;";
end KEY_MANAGER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Within the package body, the full definition of the type KEY is known.
The operation  "&lt;" declared in the visible part is a (perfectly legal)
redeclaration of  the operation  "&lt;" that  is predefined  for the type
INTEGER (the base type of NATURAL). Thus, with the declarations
<PRE>    U, V :  KEY;</PRE>
<p>
within the body of the package, the relation
<PRE>    U = V</PRE>
<p>
refers to  the predefined  operation "="  of the type INTEGER, whereas
the relation
<PRE>    U &lt; V</PRE>
<p>
refers to the operation "&lt;" defined within the package itself (in this
case, of  course, it  does  not  matter  since  this  redefinition  is
equivalent to the inherited operation). It should be noted that within
the body of the function "&lt;" itself, the relation
<PRE>    X &lt; Y</PRE>
<p>
would be  a recursive  call of the function "&lt;". Hence conversion must
be used to invoke the operation "&lt;" defined on integers, as shown:
<PRE>    INTEGER(X) &lt; INTEGER(Y)</PRE>
<p>
To summarize,  the availability  of properties  of types declared in a
package can  be deduced  from purely  textual considerations:  outside
units see  only  the  visible  part  and  consequently  can  use  only
properties defined  there; on the other hand, the package body can use
all properties,  including those  defined by the full type declaration
for a private type.

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.7">9.3.7 Initialization of Objects of Private Types</a></H3>

The elaboration of an object declaration results in the reservation of
space for  the corresponding object, whether the type of the object is
private or  not. The  initialization of  an object  whose  type  is  a
private type  could be  achieved in  the object  declaration itself by
assigning to it the value of a deferred constant or the value returned
by a  function; for  a limited private type, it could only be achieved
by a  procedure call  statement - hence not in the object declaration.
However, there  are cases  where we  want the  components of an object
whose type  is private to satisfy some invariant as soon as the object
is created,  although initialization  of other  components may  not be
needed.  This  is  achieved  by  means  of  initialization  of  record
components. Consider the following package declaration:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package ALL_ABOUT_STACKS is
  type STACK is limited private;

  procedure PUSH (E :  in  ELEMENT;  S :  in out STACK);
  procedure POP  (E :  out ELEMENT;  S :  in out STACK);
private
  type INDEX is range 0 .. 1000;
  type STACK is
    record
      TOP    :  INDEX :=  INDEX'FIRST;
      SPACE :  array (INDEX) of ELEMENT;
    end record;
end ALL_ABOUT_STACKS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For any  declaration of  an object of type STACK, the component TOP is
initialized to the minimum INDEX value. Thus, the stack invariants are
satisfied as  soon as  the declaration  of a  stack  object  has  been
elaborated (another example was shown in <a href="ratl-09-02.html#9.2.3">section 9.2.3</a> above, with the
initialization of file names in the package SAFE_INPUT_OUTPUT).

<H3><BR><a name="9.3.8">9.3.8 Private Types with Discriminants</a></H3>

A final  facility provided  by Ada  combines the  concepts of  private
types and  types with  discriminants. This  is the ability to define a
private  type  with  discriminants.  Here  is  an  example:  it  is  a
formulation of  the familiar  dimensioned units problem inspired by an
earlier formulation due to Paul Hilfinger.
<p>
The package DIMENSIONED_UNITS defines a private type that represents a
set of numerical values with physical dimensions. These dimensions are
appropriate powers  of mass,  length, and  time; so  each object has a
value and  a set  of indices  giving its  dimensionality. Objects  may
change their  values, but  they must  not change their dimensionality.
One possible solution (presented elsewhere) is to use derived types to
separate objects  of different  dimensionality; this  however does not
permit general  expressions involving  mixed dimensions to be written,
such as
<PRE>    E = M &#42; (C&#42;&#42;2)</PRE>
<p>
Another solution is to use a private type with discriminants:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package DIMENSIONED_UNITS is

  type UNIT(M, L, T :  INTEGER) is private;

  subtype MASS  is UNIT(M =&gt; 1,  L =&gt; 0,  T =&gt; 0);
  subtype LENGTH is UNIT(M =&gt; 0,  L =&gt; 1,  T =&gt; 0);
  subtype TIME  is UNIT(M =&gt; 0,  L =&gt; 0,  T =&gt; 1);
  subtype SCALAR is UNIT(0, 0, 0);

  KILO    : constant MASS;
  METER   : constant LENGTH;
  SECOND  : constant TIME;

  function "&#42;"   (LEFT :  FLOAT;  RIGHT :  UNIT) return UNIT;
  function "&#42;"   (LEFT, RIGHT :  UNIT) return UNIT;
  function "/"   (LEFT, RIGHT :  UNIT) return UNIT;
  ...
  DIMENSION_ERROR :  exception;
private
  type UNIT(M, L, T :  INTEGER :=  0) is
    record
      V :  FLOAT;
    end record;
  KILO     : constant MASS :=  (M =&gt; 1,  L =&gt; 0,  T =&gt; 0,  V =&gt; 1.0);
  METER    : constant LENGTH    :=  (M =&gt; 0,  L =&gt; 1,  T =&gt; 0,  V =&gt; 1.0);
  SECOND   : constant TIME :=  (M =&gt; 0,  L =&gt; 0,  T =&gt; 1,  V =&gt; 1.0);
end DIMENSIONED_UNITS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The user of this package may then declare entities such as:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
subtype VELOCITY is UNIT(M =&gt; 0,  L =&gt; 1,  T =&gt; -1);
subtype ENERGY is UNIT(M =&gt; 1,  L =&gt; 2,  T =&gt; -2);

C :  constant VELOCITY :=  300_000_000.0 &#42; (METER/SECOND);

function REST_ENERGY(M :  MASS) return ENERGY is
begin
  return M&#42;C&#42;C;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The implementation  of the package will contain subprogram bodies such
as:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  UNIT) return UNIT is
begin
  return   (M       =&gt; LEFT.M   + RIGHT.M,
         L =&gt; LEFT.L  + RIGHT.L,
         T =&gt; LEFT.T  + RIGHT.T,
         V =&gt; LEFT.V  &#42; RIGHT.V);
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The dimensions  must be  visible because  the user,  when declaring an
object, must  be able to specify its dimensionality. But the type must
be private  because the  operations must  check the  dimensionality of
their  operands,  and  so  must  all  be  controlled  by  the  package
DIMENSIONED_UNITS.
