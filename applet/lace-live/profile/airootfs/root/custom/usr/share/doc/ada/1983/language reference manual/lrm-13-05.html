<P>
An address clause specifies a required address in storage for an entity.
<pre>
      address_clause ::= for simple_name use at simple_expression;
</pre>
<P>
The expression given after the reserved word at must be of the type ADDRESS 
defined in the package SYSTEM (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7">13.7</a>); this package must be named by a 
with clause that applies to the compilation unit in which the address 
clause occurs.  The conventions that define the interpretation of a value 
of the type ADDRESS as an address, as an interrupt level, or whatever it 
may be, are implementation-dependent.  The allowed nature of the simple 
name and the meaning of the corresponding address are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Name of an object: the address is that required for the object 
(variable or constant).<br><br>
<li>Name of a subprogram, package, or task unit: the address is that
required for the machine code associated with the body of the program 
unit.<br><br>
<li>Name of a single entry: the address specifies a hardware interrupt to 
which the single entry is to be linked.
</ol>
If the simple name is that of a single task, the address clause is 
understood to refer to the task unit and not to the task object.  In all 
cases, the address clause is only legal if exactly one declaration with 
this identifier occurs earlier, immediately within the same declarative 
part, package specification, or task specification.  A name declared by a 
renaming declaration is not allowed as the simple name.  
<P>
Address clauses should not be used to achieve overlays of objects or 
overlays of program units. Nor should a given interrupt be linked to more 
than one entry. Any program using address clauses to achieve such effects 
is erroneous.
<P>
Example:
<pre>
    for CONTROL use at 16#0020#; -- assuming that SYSTEM.ADDRESS is an integer 
    type
</pre>
<P>
Notes:
<P>
The above rules imply that if two subprograms overload each other and are 
visible at a given point, an address clause for any of them is not legal at 
this point.  Similarly if a task specification declares entries that 
overload each other, they cannot be interrupt entries.  The syntax does not 
allow an address clause for a library unit.  An implementation may provide 
pragmas for the specification of program overlays.

<P>
An address clause given for an entry associates the entry with some device 
that may cause an interrupt; such an entry is referred to in this section 
as an interrupt entry.  If control information is supplied upon an 
interrupt, it is passed to an associated interrupt entry as one or more 
parameters of mode in; only parameters of this mode are allowed.
<P>
An interrupt acts as an entry call issued by a hardware task whose priority 
is higher than the priority of the main program, and also higher than the 
priority of any user-defined task (that is, any task whose type is declared 
by a task unit in the program).  The entry call may be an ordinary entry 
call, a timed entry call, or a conditional entry call, depending on the 
kind of interrupt and on the implementation.  
<P>
If a select statement contains both a terminate alternative and an accept 
alternative for an interrupt entry, then an implementation may impose 
further requirements for the selection of the terminate alternative in 
addition to those given in section <a href="lrm-09-04.html#9.4">9.4</a>.
<P>
Example:
<pre>
      task INTERRUPT_HANDLER is
        entry DONE;
        for DONE use at 16#40#; assuming that SYSTEM.ADDRESS is an integer 
          type
        end INTERRUPT_HANDLER;
</pre>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
Interrupt entry calls need only have the semantics described above; they 
may be implemented by having the hardware directly execute the appropriate 
accept statements. 
<P>
Queued interrupts correspond to ordinary entry calls. Interrupts that are 
lost if not immediately processed correspond to conditional entry calls. It 
is a consequence of the priority rules that an accept statement executed in 
response to an interrupt takes precedence over ordinary, user-defined 
tasks, and can be executed without first invoking a scheduling action.
<P>
One of the possible effects of an address clause for an interrupt entry is 
to specify the priority of the interrupt (directly or indirectly).  Direct 
calls to an interrupt entry are allowed.
