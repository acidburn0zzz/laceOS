<A HREF="lrm-02-01.html#2.1"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="lrm-02.html#2"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="lrm-02-03.html#2.3"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
The  text  of  a program consists of the texts of one or more compilations.
The text of each compilation is a sequence of  separate  lexical  elements.  
Each  lexical  element is either a delimiter, an identifier (which may be a
reserved word), a numeric literal, a character literal, a  string  literal,
or  a  comment.   The  effect  of  a program depends only on the particular
sequences of lexical elements that form  its  compilations,  excluding  the
comments, if any.                                                    
<P>
In  some  cases  an  explicit  separator  is  required to separate adjacent
lexical elements (namely, when  without  separation,  interpretation  as  a
single  lexical  element  is  possible).   A  separator  is  any of a space  
character, a format effector, or the end of a line.  A space character is a
separator except within a comment, a string literal, or a  space  character
literal.   Format  effectors  other  than  horizontal tabulation are always
separators.  Horizontal tabulation is a separator except within a  comment. 
<P>
The end of a line is always a separator.  The language does not define what
causes  the end of a line.  However if, for a given implementation, the end
of a line is signified by one or more  characters,  then  these  characters
must  be format effectors other than horizontal tabulation.  In any case, a
sequence of one or more format effectors other than  horizontal  tabulation
must cause at least one end of line. 
<P>
One  or  more  separators  are  allowed  between  any  two adjacent lexical
elements, before the first of each compilation,  or  after  the  last.   At
least  one separator is required between an identifier or a numeric literal
and an adjacent identifier or numeric literal. 
<P>
A delimiter is either one of the following special characters (in the basic
character set) 
<pre>
    &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; | 
</pre>
<P>
or one of the following compound delimiters each composed of  two  adjacent
special characters 
<pre>
    =&gt;   ..   **   :=   /=   &gt;=   &lt;=   &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;   &lt;&gt; 
</pre>
<P>
Each  of the special characters listed for single character delimiters is a
single delimiter except if this character is  used  as  a  character  of  a
compound  delimiter,  or  as  a  character  of  a  comment, string literal,
character literal, or numeric literal. 
<P>
The remaining forms of lexical element are described in other  sections  of
this chapter. 
<P>

Notes: 
<p>
Each  lexical  element  must  fit on one line, since the end of a line is a
separator.  The quotation, sharp, and underline  characters,  likewise  two
adjacent  hyphens,  are  not delimiters, but may form part of other lexical
elements.    
<P>
The following names are used when referring to compound delimiters: 
<pre>
    delimiter     name 

       =&gt;         arrow
       ..         double dot
       **         double star, exponentiate
       :=         assignment (pronounced: "becomes")
       /=         inequality (pronounced: "not equal")
       &gt;=         greater than or equal  
       &lt;=         less than or equal
       &lt;&lt;         left label bracket
       &gt;&gt;         right label bracket
       &lt;&gt;         box 
</pre>
