<H2>CHAPTER 10: Complete Examples</H2>

This chapter contains example programs illustrating the use of  
guidelines.  Since many of the guidelines leave the program writer to decide  
what is best, there is no single best or correct example of how to use Ada.   
Instead, you will find several styles that differ from your own that may  
deserve consideration.<P>
There are some guidelines that rarely have exceptions and leave little room 
for choice.  When you find that these examples do not reflect the way you 
normally code, investigate why by finding the guideline that was followed and 
study the rationale.  This practical exercise should be helpful in identifying 
potential areas of improvement (whether for you or this style guide!).<P>
The Menu-Driven User Interface example provides a short example demonstrating  
many of the guidelines.  It also provides the basic types for later examples.<P>
The two versions of the <a href="#10.2">Dining Philosophers example program</a> demonstrate the  
portability of Ada packages and tasking.  They were provided by Dr. Michael B.  
Feldman.  Most of the available compilers can successfully compile these  
examples.  They have also been successfully tested on a variety of platforms.
