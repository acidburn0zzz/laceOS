<P>
The form of Ada program units is  described  by  means  of  a  context-free
syntax  together with context-dependent requirements expressed by narrative
rules. 
<P>
The meaning of Ada program units is described by means of  narrative  rules
defining  both  the effects of each construct and the composition rules for
constructs.   This  narrative  employs  technical   terms   whose   precise
definition  is  given in the text (references to the section containing the
definition of a technical term appear at the end of each section that  uses
the term). 
<P>
All other terms are in the English language and bear their natural meaning,
as  defined  in Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English
Language.  
<P>
The context-free syntax of the language is described using a simple variant
of Backus-Naur-Form.  In particular, 
<ol>
<li>Lower case words, some containing embedded  underlines,  are  used  to
denote syntactic categories, for example: 
<br><tt>
adding_operator  
</tt><br>
Whenever the name of a syntactic  category  is  used  apart  from  the
syntax  rules  themselves,  spaces  take  the  place of the underlines
(thus:  adding operator). 
<br><br>
<li>Boldface words are used to denote reserved words, for example: 
<br><tt>
array  
</tt><br>
<li>Square brackets enclose optional items.  Thus the two following  rules
are equivalent.<br>
<tt>
return_statement ::= return [expression];<br>
return_statement ::= return; | return expression;  
</tt><br>
<li>Braces enclose a repeated item.  The item  may  appear  zero  or  more  
times;  the repetitions occur from left to right as with an equivalent
left-recursive rule.  Thus the two following rules are equivalent.<br>
<tt>
term ::= factor {multiplying_operator factor}<br>
term ::= factor | term multiplying_operator factor                                                       
</tt><br>
<li>A  vertical  bar  separates  alternative  items   unless   it   occurs
immediately  after  an  opening  brace,  in  which  case it stands for
itself:<br>
<tt>
letter_or_digit ::= letter | digit<br>
component_association ::= [choice {| choice} =&gt;] expression  
</tt><br>
<li>If the name of any syntactic category starts with an italicized  part,
it  is  equivalent  to  the category name without the italicized part.
The italicized part is intended to convey some  semantic  information.
For example type_name and task_name are both equivalent to name alone.
</ol>

Note: 
<p>
The  syntax  rules describing structured constructs are presented in a form
that corresponds to the  recommended  paragraphing.   For  example,  an  if
statement is defined as 
<pre>
    if_statement ::=
        if condition then
          sequence_of_statements
       {elsif condition then
          sequence_of_statements}
       [else
          sequence_of_statements]
        end if; 
</pre>
<P>
Different  lines  are  used for parts of a syntax rule if the corresponding
parts of the construct  described  by  the  rule  are  intended  to  be  on
different   lines.   Indentation  in  the  rule  is  a  recommendation  for
indentation of the corresponding part of the construct.  It is  recommended
that  all  indentations be by multiples of a basic step of indentation (the
number of spaces for the basic step is not defined).  The preferred  places
for  other  line  breaks  are  after  semicolons.   On the other hand, if a
complete construct can fit on  one  line,  this  is  also  allowed  in  the
recommended paragraphing.
