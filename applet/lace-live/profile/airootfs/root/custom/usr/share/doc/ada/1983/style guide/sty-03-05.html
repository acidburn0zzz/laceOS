<UL>
<li>Use underscores to separate words in a compound name. 
<li>Represent numbers in a consistent fashion.  
<li>Represent literals in a radix appropriate to the problem. 
<li>Use underscores to separate digits the same way commas or periods (or  
spaces for nondecimal bases) would be used in handwritten text.  
<li>  When using scientific notation, make the <CODE>E</CODE> consistently either upper 
or lower case. 
<li>  In an alternate base, represent the alphabetic characters in either 
all upper case or all lower case. 
<li>  Make reserved words and other elements of the program visually 
distinct from each other. 
<li>Do not use an abbreviation of a long word as an identifier where a  
shorter synonym exists. 
<li>Use a consistent abbreviation strategy. 
<li>Do not use ambiguous abbreviations. 
<li>An abbreviation must save many characters over the full word to be  
justified. 
<li>Use abbreviations that are well-accepted in the application domain. 
<li> Maintain a list of accepted abbreviations and use only abbreviations 
on that list. 
</UL>

<H4><a name="3.5.2">3.2 naming conventions</a></H4>
<UL>
<li>Choose names that are as self-documenting as possible. 
<li>Use a short synonym instead of an abbreviation (see <a href="sty-03-01.html#3.1.4">Guideline 3.1.4</a>). 
<li>Use names given by the application but not obscure jargon. 
<li>Use singular, general nouns as (sub)type identifiers. 
<li>Choose identifiers that describe one of the (sub)type's values. 
<li>  Do not use identifier constructions (e.g., suffixes) that are unique 
to (sub)type identifiers. 
<li>Do not use the type names from predefined packages. 
<li>Use predicate clauses or adjectives for boolean objects. 
<li>Use singular, specific nouns as object identifiers. 
<li>Choose identifiers that describe the object's value during execution. 
<li>Use singular, general nouns as identifiers for record components. 
<li>Use action verbs for procedures and entries. 
<li>Use predicate-clauses for boolean functions. 
<li>Use nouns for nonboolean functions. 
<li>Give packages names that imply higher levels of organization than  
subprograms. Generally, these are noun phrases that describe the abstraction  
provided.  
<li>Give tasks names that imply an active entity.   
<li>Name generic subprograms as if they were nongeneric subprograms. 
<li>Name generic packages as if they were nongeneric packages. 
<li>Make the generic names more general than the instantiated names. 
<li>Use symbolic values instead of literals wherever possible. 
<li>Use constants instead of variables for constant values.   
<li>Use named numbers instead of constants when possible. 
<li>Use named numbers to replace numeric literals whose type or context is  truly universal. 
<li>Use constants for objects whose values cannot change after elaboration  (United Technologies 1987). 
<li>  Show relationships between symbolic values by defining them with 
static expressions. 
<li>Use linearly independent sets of literals. 
<li>Use attributes like «<CODE>First</CODE> and <CODE>«Last</CODE> instead of literals wherever  possible. 
</UL>

<H4><a name="3.5.3">3.3 comments</a></H4>
<UL>
<li>Make the code as clear as possible to reduce the need for comments. 
<li>  Never repeat information in a comment which is readily available in 
the code. 
<li>Where a comment is required, make it concise and complete. 
<li>Use proper grammar and spelling in comments. 
<li>Make comments visually distinct from the code. 
<li>Structure comments in headers so that information can be automatically  extracted by a tool. 
<li>Put a file header on each source file. 
<li>Place ownership, responsibility, and history information for the file  
in the file header. 
<li>Put a header on the specification of each program unit. 
<li>Place information required by the user of the program unit in the  
specification header. 
<li>Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the specification  
header which is present in the specification. 
<li>Explain what the unit does, not how or why it does it. 
<li>Describe the complete interface to the program unit, including any  
exceptions it can raise and any global effects it can have. 
<li>Do not include information about how the unit fits into the enclosing  
software system. 
<li>Describe the performance (time and space) characteristics of the unit.
<li> Place information required by the maintainer of the program unit in 
the body header. 
<li>Explain how and why the unit performs its function, not what the unit  
does. 
<li>Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the header that is  
readily apparent from reading the code. 
<li>  Do not repeat information (except unit name) in the body header that 
is available in the specification header. 
<li>Comment on all data types, objects, and exceptions unless their names  
are self-explanatory. 
<li>Include information on the semantic structure of complex pointer-based data structures. 
<li>Include information about relationships that are maintained between  
data objects. 
<li>Do not include comments that merely repeat the information in the name. 
<li>Minimize comments embedded among statements. 
<li>Use comments only to explain parts of the code that are not obvious. 
<li>Comment intentional omissions from the code. 
<li>Do not use comments to paraphrase the code. 
<li>Do not use comments to explain remote pieces of code, such as  
subprograms called by the current unit. 
<li>Where comments are necessary, make them visually distinct from the  
code. 
<li>Use pagination markers to mark program unit boundaries (<a href="sty-02-01.html#2.1.7">Guideline 2.1.7</a>). 
<li>Repeat the unit name in a comment to mark the begin of a package body,  
subprogram body, task body, or block <u>if</u> the begin is preceded by declarations. 
<li>For long or heavily nested if and case statements, mark the end of the  
statement with a comment summarizing the condition governing the statement. 
<li>For long or heavily nested if statements, mark the else part with a  
comment summarizing the conditions governing this portion of the statement. 
</UL>

<H4><a name="3.5.4">3.4 using types</a></H4>
<UL>
<li>Limit the range of scalar types as much as possible. 
<li>Seek information about possible values from the application. 
<li>Do not overload any of the type names in package Standard. 
<li>Use subtype declarations to improve program readability (Booch 1987). 
<li>Use derived types and subtypes in concert (see <a href="sty-05-03.html#5.3.1">Guideline 5.3.1</a>). 
<li>Use enumeration types instead of numeric codes.  
<li>Use representation clauses to match requirements of external devices. 
</UL>
