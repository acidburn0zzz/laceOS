<H2>CHAPTER 13: Tasking</H2>

<H3><a name="13.1">13.1 Introduction</a></H3>

Tasking is  an important  aspect of  many embedded  systems  and  this
importance  was  clearly  recognized  in  the  Steelman  requirements.
However tasking  seems  to  have  been  neglected  in  most  languages
currently in  production use  for such systems. One reason has clearly
been a lack of confidence in the many different facilities put forward
for the  control of parallelism. Semaphores, events, signals and other
similar mechanisms  are clearly  at too  low a level. Monitors, on the
other hand,  are  not  always  easy  to  understand  and,  with  their
associated signals,  perhaps seem to offer an unfortunate mix of high-
level and  low-level concepts.  It is believed that Ada strikes a good
balance by providing facilities that are not only easy to use directly
but can  also be  used as  tools for  the creation  of  mechanisms  of
different kinds.
<p>
The basic  textual concept  in Ada is that of a task, which in form is
closely analogous  to a  package. Tasks  are automatically executed in
parallel  with  the  unit  in  which  they  are  declared,  and  their
termination similarly  follows the  scope structure. Task types enable
the declaration  of a dynamic number of tasks with similar properties.
This facility,  when used  in conjunction  with access  types,  allows
flexible control  over the  number  of  tasks  in  a  system  and  the
manipulation of task identities.
<p>
Communication and  synchronization are both achieved using the concept
of a  rendezvous between  a task  issuing an  entry call  and  a  task
accepting the call by an accept statement. An entry call is similar to
a procedure call except that the calling and called tasks are distinct
and synchronized.
<p>
Timing control  is provided  by the  delay statement  together with  a
package that defines operations on times and dates.
<p>
Great power  is provided by the select statement, which enables a task
to respond  to several different possible entry calls. Variants of the
select statement  provide timed-out and conditional communication in a
natural manner.  Interrupts may  be handled by a representation clause
associated with a particular entry.
<p>
This chapter comprises two main parts. The first describes the tasking
facilities and  illustrates their  use with examples. This is followed
by a  brief historical survey of parallel processing mechanisms, which
puts the Ada concepts into perspective.
