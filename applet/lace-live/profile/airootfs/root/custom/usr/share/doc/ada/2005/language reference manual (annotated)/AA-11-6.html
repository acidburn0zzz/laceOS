&ldquo;<A HREF="AA-1-1-3.html">Conformity of an Implementation with the

of its interactions with its external environment. Hence, the implementation 
can perform any internal actions whatsoever, in any order or in parallel, 
so long as the external effect of the execution of the program is one 
that is allowed by the canonical semantics, or by the rules of this clause.]

can change the external effect of the program, so long as the changed 
external effect is an external effect that is allowed by the semantics. 
Note that the canonical semantics of an erroneous execution allows any 
external effect whatsoever. Hence, if the implementation can prove that 
program execution will be erroneous in certain circumstances, there need 
not be any constraints on the machine code executed in those circumstances.

<H4 Class="centered">Implementation Permissions</H4>
<DIV Class="paranum">4</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The following additional 
permissions are granted to the implementation:&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5</DIV>
<UL Class="Bulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>extra 
permission to avoid raising exceptions</I>}</SPAN> <A NAME="I4659"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>undefined 
result</I>}</SPAN> <A NAME="I4660"></A>An implementation need not always 
raise an exception when a language-defined check fails. Instead, the 
operation that failed the check can simply yield an <I>undefined result</I>. 
The exception need be raised by the implementation only if, in the absence 
of raising it, the value of this undefined result would have some effect 
on the external interactions of the program. In determining this, the 
implementation shall not presume that an undefined result has a value 
that belongs to its subtype, nor even to the base range of its type, 
if scalar. [Having removed the raise of the exception, the canonical 
semantics will in general allow the implementation to omit the code for 
the check, and some or all of the operation itself.]&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>Even without this permission, 
an implementation can always remove a check if it cannot possibly fail. 
</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>We express the permission in 
terms of removing the raise, rather than the operation or the check, 
as it minimizes the disturbance to the canonical semantics (thereby simplifying 
reasoning). By allowing the implementation to omit the raise, it thereby 
does not need to &quot;look&quot; at what happens in the exception handler 
to decide whether the optimization is allowed.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The implementation can also 
omit checks if they cannot possibly fail, or if they could only fail 
in erroneous executions. This follows from the canonical semantics.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.d</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em"><B>Implementation 
Note:&nbsp;</B>This permission is intended to allow normal &quot;dead code 
removal&quot; optimizations, even if some of the removed code might have 
failed some language-defined check. However, one may not eliminate the 
raise of an exception if subsequent code presumes in some way that the 
check succeeded. For example:&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.e</DIV>
<DIV Class="SmallExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>if</B>&nbsp;X&nbsp;*&nbsp;Y&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Integer'Last&nbsp;<B>then</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put_Line(&quot;X&nbsp;*&nbsp;Y&nbsp;overflowed&quot;);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end</B>&nbsp;<B>if</B>;<BR>
<B>exception</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>when</B>&nbsp;<B>others</B>&nbsp;=&gt;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put_Line(&quot;X&nbsp;*&nbsp;Y&nbsp;overflowed&quot;);</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.e.1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><SPAN class="delete1"></SPAN>If X*Y does overflow, 
you may not remove the raise of the exception if the code that does the 
comparison against Integer'Last presumes that it is comparing it with 
an in-range Integer value, and hence always yields False.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.f</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">As another example 
where a raise may not be eliminated:&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.g</DIV>
<DIV Class="SmallExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>subtype</B>&nbsp;Str10&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;String(1..10);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;P10&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;<B>access</B>&nbsp;Str10;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;:&nbsp;P10&nbsp;:=&nbsp;<B>null</B>;<BR>
<B>begin</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>if</B>&nbsp;X.all'Last&nbsp;=&nbsp;10&nbsp;<B>then</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put_Line(&quot;Oops&quot;);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end</B>&nbsp;<B>if</B>;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.g.1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">In the above code, it would be wrong to eliminate 
the raise of Constraint_Error on the &quot;X.all&quot; (since X is null), 
if the code to evaluate 'Last always yields 10 by presuming that X.all 
belongs to the subtype Str10, without even &quot;looking.&quot;&nbsp;</DIV>

the corresponding <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-11-2.html#S0248">exception_handler</A></SPAN>

</LI></UL>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>We allow such variables to become 
abnormal so that assignments (other than to atomic variables) can be 
disrupted due to &ldquo;imprecise&rdquo; exceptions or instruction scheduling, 
and so that assignments can be reordered so long as the correct results 
are produced in the end if no language-defined checks fail.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>If a check fails, no result 
dependent on the check may be incorporated in an external interaction. 
In other words, there is no permission to output meaningless results 
due to postponing a check.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>We believe it is important 
to state the extra permission to reorder actions in terms of what the 
programmer can expect at run time, rather than in terms of what the implementation 
can assume, or what transformations the implementation can perform. Otherwise, 
how can the programmer write reliable programs?</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.d</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">This clause has two conflicting goals: to allow 
as much optimization as possible, and to make program execution as predictable 
as possible (to ease the writing of reliable programs). The rules given 
above represent a compromise.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.e</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Consider the two extremes:</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.f</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">The extreme conservative rule would be to delete 
this clause entirely. The semantics of Ada would be the canonical semantics. 
This achieves the best predictability. It sounds like a disaster from 
the efficiency point of view, but in practice, implementations would 
provide modes in which less predictability but more efficiency would 
be achieved. Such a mode could even be the out-of-the-box mode. In practice, 
implementers would provide a compromise based on their customer's needs. 
Therefore, we view this as one viable alternative.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.g</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">The extreme liberal rule would be &ldquo;the 
language does not specify the execution of a program once a language-defined 
check has failed; such execution can be unpredictable.&rdquo; This achieves 
the best efficiency. It sounds like a disaster from the predictability 
point of view, but in practice it might not be so bad. A user would have 
to assume that exception handlers for exceptions raised by language-defined 
checks are not portable. They would have to isolate such code (like all 
nonportable code), and would have to find out, for each implementation 
of interest, what behaviors can be expected. In practice, implementations 
would tend to avoid going so far as to punish their customers too much 
in terms of predictability.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.h</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">The most important thing about this clause is 
that users understand what they can expect at run time, and implementers 
understand what optimizations are allowed. Any solution that makes this 
clause contain rules that can interpreted in more than one way is unacceptable.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">6.i</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">We have chosen a compromise between the extreme 
conservative and extreme liberal rules. The current rule essentially 
allows arbitrary optimizations within a library unit and inlined subprograms 
reachable from it, but disallow semantics-disrupting optimizations across 
library units in the absence of inlined subprograms. This allows a library 
unit to be debugged, and then reused with some confidence that the abstraction 
it manages cannot be broken by bugs outside the library unit.&nbsp;</DIV>
