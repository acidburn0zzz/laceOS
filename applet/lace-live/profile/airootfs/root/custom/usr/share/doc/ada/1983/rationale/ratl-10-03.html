<H2>CHAPTER 10: Separate Compilation and Libraries</H2>

<H3><a name="10.3">10.3 Methodological Impact of Separate Compilation</a></H3>

The ability  to compile  separately a  package specification  and  the
corresponding package  body has  important methodological consequences
for program development and maintenance. For example, it allows a team
of programmers  to agree  upon a  common interface and to define it by
one or  more package  specifications. This  being  done,  the  package
bodies, and  any other  unit that  uses the  common interface,  can be
developed in parallel and compiled in an arbitrary order.
<p>
A package  specification contains all the declarations that need to be
seen  by  any  unit  that  uses  the  services  of  the  package.  The
corresponding package  body may be modified and recompiled without the
need for  recompilation of  the units  that use  the services  of  the
package. As  long as  the operations  promised by the visible part are
correctly achieved,  the user  will not  be affected by changes to the
package body.  Another version  of the package body, using a different
technique, may be substituted without affecting the user.
<p>
This ability  to compile a package specification and the corresponding
package body  separately is an extension of the idea of encapsulation.
Since users  are not  affected by  the contents  of the package body -
provided it is correct - there is no need to show them the source text
of the package body: all they need is the corresponding object code.
<p>
Separate compilation  of package  bodies may  thus be  used to achieve
physical hiding.  This will be useful for confidentiality purposes. It
will also  help to  prevent users  from  reading  the  algorithms  and
inferring implicit properties and making assumptions that might not be
satisfied by later implementations. In this sense, separately compiled
package bodies  provide good support for the policy of restricted flow
of information advocated by Parnas <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[PA 71]</a>.
