<H2>CHAPTER 11: General Program Structure - Visibility and Overloading</H2>

<H3><a name="11.5">11.5 Overload Resolution</a></H3>

When an overloaded name or symbol occurs, the language translator must
determine which of several possible definitions is meant. This process
is  called   overload  resolution,  and  it  must  naturally  rely  on
information from the context in which the name occurs. In defining the
language, the  rules for  overload resolution  need to be established,
and these rules must make clear two things:
<ul>
<li>what is the context from which information is to be taken

<li>what information may be used
</ul>

As an example of the former question, consider the fragment
<PRE>    for I in MIN(A,B) .. MAX(C,D) loop</PRE>
<p>
and how we might resolve the overloaded function MIN.
<ol type =a>
<li>consider only  the context  MIN(A,B);  that  is,  the
   function and its actual parameter list;<br><br>
<li>consider the  context MIN(A,B) .. MAX(C,D), including
   the fact that the result types of the two calls must be the same;<br><br>
<li>consider the  context for I in MIN(A,B) ..  MAX(C,D),
   including the fact that the result types must be the same, and must
   be of a discrete type.
</ol>

As an  example of the latter question, consider a call of CREATE, from
the package SIMPLE_IO of <a href="ratl-09-02.html#9.2.3">section 9.2.3</a>:
<PRE>    CREATE(FILE =&gt; OUTFILE,  NAME =&gt; "Results");</PRE>
<p>
and what  information we should use to determine which CREATE is being
invoked:
<ol type=a start=4>
<li>there are two actual parameters<br><br>
<li>their types are FILE_NAME and STRING<br><br>
<li>their formal names are FILE and NAME<br><br>
<li>since "Results"  is a string literal, the mode of the
   NAME parameter must be in
</ol>

We shall consider these two issues in turn.

It might  appear that  the simplest overload resolution rule is to use
everything -  all information  from as wide a context as possible - to
resolve the  overloaded reference.  This rule may be simple, but it is
not helpful.  It requires  the human  reader to scan arbitrarily large
pieces of  text, and  to make  arbitrarily complex inferences (such as
(g) above).  We believe  that a better rule is one that makes explicit
the task  a human  reader or  a compiler  must perform, and that makes
this task as natural for the human reader as possible.
<p>
The contexts to be used in overload resolution are given explicitly in
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-08-07.html#8.7">RM 8.7</a>.  They correspond, we believe, to the natural program fragments
that both  writer and  reader will  regard as  conceptual  units.  For
example, the  controlling expression  of a for loop is such a unit: it
represents a bounded, ordered iteration over a set of discrete values.
Accordingly, the resolution process considers (a), (b), and (c) above:
both bounds  of the  range, and  also the fact of its discreteness. We
can therefore resolve
<PRE>    for F in ORANGE .. KIWI loop</PRE>
<p>
in the  way that  we believe  the human  reader would: as an iteration
over fruits.
<p>
As another example, consider the case statement
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case BIRD_IN_THE_HAND is   -- (1)
  when KIWI =&gt;            -- (2)
    ...
    -- imagine a lot of text here
  when ORANGE =&gt;          -- (3)
    ...
  ...
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The case  expression and  the values  in the case alternatives must of
course all  have  the  same  type.  However,  Ada  requires  the  case
expression, on  line (1), to be resolved first, before considering the
case arms.  This is because, otherwise, the human reader would have to
scan an  arbitrarily large  amount of  text in order to understand the
very first  line  of  the  case  statement.  This  would  violate  our
convention (sanctioned  by both  Ada  and  natural  usage)  of  linear
readability. With  the Ada  rule, the  reader knows  at point (2) that
KIWI is an APTERON, and knows at point (3) that ORANGE is an error.

<H3><BR><a name="11.5.2">11.5.2 Information Used to Resolve Overloading</a></H3>

A more  difficult issue  is, what information should be taken from the
context of  resolution? Since  the main  purpose of  overloading is to
allow analogous  operations on  different types  to be  given the same
name, resolution  clearly must  consider type  information. The  other
information  available   is  the   order,  names,  and  modes  of  the
parameters, the presence of defaults, and the result type.
<p>
The rationale  behind the  Ada position is threefold. First, the rules
should be  convenient for, and comprehensible to, the human reader and
writer: this  must override  any consideration of compiler simplicity.
Secondly, the rules should allow natural programming conventions to be
followed with  unsurprising results.  Thirdly,  the  information  used
should be  readily observable  in the  program text,  and  not  highly
implicit.
<H4>Overloaded Operations</H4>
<p>
It seems  best to  consider first  the overloading  of operations. The
natural use  of operator  symbols is  in infix notation, where clearly
the order  of the parameters matters, but the formal names do not. And
Ada therefore uses the one, and not the other. Thus, given
<PRE>    function "-" (LEFT :  TIME;  RIGHT  :  DURATION) return TIME;</PRE>
<p>
then an expression such as
<PRE>    MIDNIGHT - 10&#42;MINUTE</PRE>
<p>
is interpreted  as subtracting  a DURATION  from a  TIME (assuming the
declaration of  MIDNIGHT as  a variable  of type TIME, and MINUTE as a
constant of type DURATION), but
<PRE>    10&#42;MINUTE - MIDNIGHT</PRE>
<p>
will fail: the operands are in the wrong order.
<p>
However, Ada does not permit these overloadings:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "-" (LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER) return INTEGER;
function "-" (MINUEND, SUBTRAHEND :  INTEGER) return INTEGER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
because, even  if we  did happen  to remember the traditional names of
the operands,  we would  never use  them in  an invocation  of the "-"
operator. The  formal names  will never  be seen at the point of call,
and so cannot be considered in overload resolution.
<p>
Since operations  are functions,  the parameter mode must always be in
and so  is irrelevant  to  the  resolution.  There  remains  only  the
question of the result type.
<p>
Some languages,  such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 68</a>,  do not  use the result type of an
operation to  assist in  overload resolution.  This has  the advantage
that it  leads to an implementation of overload resolution by a single
bottom-up  traversal   of  the   expression.  But   is  this  admitted
convenience for the compiler writer accompanied by any benefit for the
human programmer?
<p>
There are  few cases  in conventional  mathematics where  an  abstract
operation may yield two different types of result, but these cases are
significant. One example is the distinction between scalar product and
vector product. It is surely desirable to allow
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  VECTOR) return SCALAR;
function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  VECTOR) return MATRIX;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
since otherwise  one hapless  programmer will  have to  abandon  infix
notation completely, and the other will have to fight for his monopoly
over the "&#42;" symbol.
<p>
As another example, consider the rational constructor
<PRE>    function "/" (LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER) return RATIONAL;</PRE>
<p>
defined above. It is hard to imagine any better way of writing
<PRE>    ALMOST_PI :=  355/113;</PRE>
<p>
But this requires the ability to overload "/" on the result type.
<p>
We conclude  that the  use of  the function  result type  in  overload
resolution  is  methodologically  the  better  choice,  and  one  that
enhances  the   freedom  of   the   programmer   to   write   natural,
comprehensible expressions.

<H4>Overloaded Names</H4>
<p>
Named  procedures   and  functions,   called  by  conventional  prefix
notation, present  a rather  different  issue.  This  is  because  Ada
permits both  positional and  named  parameter  association,  for  the
reasons given  in <a href="ratl-08-03.html#8.3">section 8.3</a>. Moreover, procedure parameters may take
one of  three modes:  in, in  out,  out;  and  in  parameters  may  be
defaulted. Potentially, all this information is available for overload
resolution.
<p>
To resolve  overloading, Ada  uses the formal names but not the modes;
that is, (d), (e) and (f) above, as described in <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-06-06.html#6.6">RM 6.6</a>. The reason is
simple: the  programmer may  write the  formal names explicitly in the
call statement,  but has no means of indicating the modes at the place
of the  call (since  all parameter  associations use "=&gt;"). Hence, the
formal names  can be made explicit, but the modes are always implicit,
and the natural action is to use explicit information where given, but
to avoid  using implicit  information that the human reader might have
difficulty in deducing.

<H3><BR><a name="11.5.3">11.5.3 Ambiguity</a></H3>

An overloaded  name is  potentially ambiguous.  In practice, even with
the best  programming style,  actual ambiguities will sometimes arise,
in the  form of  expressions that  cannot be resolved. The most common
reason is  accident: two  packages are  jointly used;  each defines  a
consistent set  of names;  but there is a clash of names. For example,
consider the  packages PALETTE  and BOTANY  defined above.  One cannot
find fault with these packages individually, but then
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with PALETTE,  BOTANY;
use  PALETTE,  BOTANY;
procedure P is
  ...
  PUT(ORANGE);
  ...
end P;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
contains an  ambiguous call  of PUT  - one that is ambiguous even when
all available information is used.
<p>
Clearly, the  programmer must  provide more information. There are two
sorts of  information that  Ada permits  one to  provide:  information
about the  source of  a name,  and  information  about  its  type.  To
illustrate the former, consider
<PRE>    BOTANY.PUT(ORANGE);</PRE>
<p>
This is  clearly unambiguous, since only one PUT is defined in package
BOTANY. Ada  dot notation can always be used to give information about
the source that provides the name, and, if the package in question has
been properly  written, this  information should suffice. Indeed, this
property is  essential if packages are to be generally useful software
components, since  it guarantees  that a  properly-constructed package
can be  used by  anyone, regardless  of what  other packages  they may
need.
<p>
To illustrate how type information can be given, consider
<PRE>    PUT(FRUIT'(ORANGE));</PRE>
<p>
This also  is unambiguous: ORANGE is a FRUIT, and so the PUT that puts
fruits is  intended. Since  type names cannot be overloaded, and since
all expressions  can be  qualified, this  method also ensures overload
resolution.
<p>
By either  of these  methods, the  user who  by accident encounters an
ambiguity can make the intended meaning explicit.
