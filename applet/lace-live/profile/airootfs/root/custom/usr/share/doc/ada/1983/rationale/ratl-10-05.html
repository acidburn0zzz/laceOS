<H2>CHAPTER 10: Separate Compilation and Libraries</H2>

<H3><a name="10.5">10.5 The Implementation of Separate Compilation</a></H3>

The  Ada  separate  compilation  facility  can  be  implemented  at  a
reasonable cost  for the  simple strategy  where the quantum of change
recognized by  the compiler  is the  compilation or recompilation of a
single unit.  The model  described below  is similar  to the technique
used in compilers for the <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis</a> language.

<H3><BR><a name="10.5.1">10.5.1 Principle of Separate Compilation</a></H3>

As mentioned  before, the Ada separate compilation facility involves a
program library  that records  information on compilation units and on
dependence relations between them.
<p>
The library  file associated with the program library can be organized
as a  collection of  records: one  for each  compilation  unit.  If  a
compilation unit  includes declarations  that are  potentially visible
from other  compilation units, the corresponding record must contain a
description of  these declarations  - commonly  called a symbol table.
This need arises in the following cases:

<ul>
<li><b>Any library  unit:</b> The  symbol table describes the specification of
   the package, subprogram, or generic unit.
<p>
<li><b>Any compilation  unit that has subunits:</b> The symbol table describes
   the declarative environment of each stub.
</ul>

These symbol  tables are produced and managed by the compiler. For the
compilation of  a given  unit, the  compiler must  first retrieve  the
symbol tables  that describe  the current  context, and  then assemble
them as  appropriate. In  other words,  the compiler must construct an
integrated symbol  table that describes visibility for the compilation
unit as if the program were not split into separate texts.
<p>
In order  to perform  this task it is useful to consider the following
forest structure  (a collection of genealogical trees), which reflects
the declaration of units and subunits:
<ol type=a>
<li>Each library unit is a root.
<p>
<li>The parent  unit of a subunit is the compilation unit
   that contains the corresponding body stub.
</ol>

This structure is necessary for the determination of visibility rules.
Hence it  must be recorded in the library file and updated as new body
stubs are encountered, and as new units are compiled.
<p>
Finally, for each compilation unit, the list of library units that are
mentioned by  its context  clause must  be kept.  The forest structure
will help  for determining  the symbol  tables to  be  retrieved,  for
checking the  validity of  context clauses  and  for  determining  the
recompilations that  need to  be done  as a  consequence  of  previous
recompilations. Naturally,  the compiler may also use this information
to assist the user with recompilations.
<p>
To check for required recompilations, the compiler may use a system of
time-stamping that  reflects  the  order  in  which  compilations  are
submitted: a  unique compilation  date is  associated with  the symbol
table of each compilation unit.

<H3><BR><a name="10.5.2">10.5.2 Details of the Actions Performed by the Compiler</a></H3>

The following  major actions  must be performed during the compilation
of a compilation unit:
<p>
<DL>
<DT><b>Determination of the compilation context</b>
<p>
<DD>The context clause is analyzed and the name of the compilation unit is
recognized. Using  the full  name of  the  subunit  (given  after  the
reserved word  separate), the genealogy of a subunit can be found: its
parent, grandparent,  and so  on up  to the  ancestor library  unit. A
combined with  clause is  formed by  merging the  with clauses  of the
genealogy.
<p>

<DT><b>Checking the validity of the compilation context</b>
<p>
<DD>Any unit mentioned by a context clause must be a library unit.
<p>
The following checks must be performed:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>In the  genealogy, each  subunit must  have been compiled after its
   parent.
<p>
<li>Each compilation  unit of  the genealogy  must have  been  compiled
   after any library unit mentioned by its context clause.
<p>
<li>Each library  unit mentioned  by the  combined context  clause must
   still be  valid: A  compilation unit  is no  longer  valid  if  its
   context clause names a library unit that is no longer valid or that
   has been compiled after the compilation unit itself.
</ul>
<p>
Compilation may  proceed only  if all  these checks succeed. Otherwise
diagnostics, a  list of  required recompilations,  and  a  recommended
recompilation order may be printed by the compiler.
<p>

<DT><b>Table loading</b>
<p>
<DD>The symbol tables of the library units named by the merged with clause
may now  be assembled.  For a  subunit the constitution of the current
context also  involves nesting  the declarative  parts of the units of
the genealogy  - layer  by layer,  from the  ancestor to the immediate
parent.
<p>
This table  assembly may  involve establishing  some links between the
individual symbol  tables, since  they may  refer to  each other  (for
example, an  identifier declared  in a  given package may be of a type
declared in another package).
<p>

<DT><b>Update of the forest structure, table unloading</b>
<p>
<DD>At the  end of  the compilation  of a  compilation unit,  the date  of
compilation must  be updated.  For a library unit, and for a unit that
contains body  stubs (and  therefore has subunits), a new symbol table
must be  stored in  the library  file  in  a  suitable  format.  Newly
declared subunits must be entered in the forest. If a new library unit
is compiled, a root must be added to the forest.
<p>
The forest  structure can  be used  to mark  units  that  have  become
invalid as  a consequence  of the  current compilation  and for  which
recompilation will therefore be needed.
</DL>

<H3><BR><a name="10.5.3">10.5.3 Treatment of Package Bodies</a></H3>

For a  given package,  the two disjoint units (specification and body)
must be  viewed as  defining complementary aspects of the same logical
entity. Consequently  it will  be convenient  for the  user to  have a
single object module, and not two. In order to achieve this effect the
code produced  during the compilation of the package specification, if
any, may  be kept  in some  intermediate form  in the  record that  is
associated with  the package  in  the  program  library.  Later,  when
compiling the package body, this initial code may be recovered and the
compilations may  proceed as  if the two units were concatenated. (The
code produced  for the  specification must  still be retained, in case
the body is recompiled.)

<H3><BR><a name="10.5.4">10.5.4 Summary of the Information Contained
in a Library File</a></H3>

The library  file contains  a representation  of the  forest structure
discussed above.  Each node of a tree corresponds to a subunit, except
the root, which is always a library unit. A node contains:
<ul>
<li>The name of the unit or subunit.
<p>
<li>Its nature: subprogram, package, generic unit, or task unit.
<p>
<li>Its compilation date and that of the associated unit body, if there
   is one.
<p>
<li>The list of library units mentioned in the context clause.
<p>
<li>A symbol  table, if  the compilation  unit is a library unit and in
   any case if it includes body stubs (has subunits).
<p>
<li>Possibly, a boolean component indicating need for recompilation.
</ul>

The record  for a  given node  is created  either when  the stub for a
subunit is  analyzed (and  then initialized in the state recompilation
needed), or  during compilation  in the  case of  a library unit. This
record is updated during compilations. The record for a subunit may be
deleted from the library file upon recompilation of the parent unit if
this unit no longer has a corresponding body stub.
<p>
Each  individual  symbol  table  should  be  kept  in  a  format  that
simplifies establishment  of the  relations between  different  symbol
tables when  they are  assembled. As  an  example,  consider  the  two
following packages:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package D is
  type T is ...
  ...
end D;

with D;
package E is
  use D;
  X :  T;
  ...
end E;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Given the  symbol table  entry for  the declaration  of X,  it must be
possible to find the symbol table entry for its type T.
<p>
If internal references are used to represent such relations, they must
be relocated  when the  symbol tables are assembled. Methods involving
relocation information,  or a  mapping into virtual memory can be used
to support this table assembly.
<p>
Note, finally,  that symbol tables may be transferred from the library
file of one program to that of another program. The internal structure
adopted for symbol tables should permit this.
