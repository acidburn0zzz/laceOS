<h1>
6   Subprograms
</h1>


<p>
Perhaps the most important change to subprograms and their use in Ada 95
is the fact that they are more nearly first class types since they may be
manipulated as the target of access types.  However, this topic is dealt
with in Chapter 3 and we concern ourselves here with other relatively
minor improvements to subprograms.  These are
</p>
<ul>
<li>
     Various aspects of the parameter and result mechanism are improved.
     The notions of by-copy and by-reference parameters are made more
     formal.  Parameters of mode out may now be read.  Subprograms may
     have parameters of mode out for a limited view of a type.
<li>
    A parameter may also be of an anonymous access type.
<li>
    A subprogram body may now be provided by renaming; this and other
     changes increases the categories of conformance rules.
<li>
    The rules for new overloadings of "=" and "/=" are relaxed.
</ul>
<p>
Other related matters are the calling conventions for interfacing with
other languages; these are discussed in Part Three.  Abstract subprograms
are discussed in Chapter 3.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=1>
6.1  Parameter and Result Mechanism
</a>
</h2>

<p>
For Ada 95, we define by-copy parameter passing in terms of a subtype
conversion and an assignment.  This minimizes the number of special rules
associated with parameter passing.
</p>
<p>
For by-reference parameters, the formal parameter is considered a view
of the actual.
</p>
<p>
Certain types are called by-copy types and are always passed by copy.
Some other types are called by-reference types and are always passed by
reference.  For the remaining types the implementation is free to choose
either mechanism.  Note that the parameter mechanism is independent of
the view; thus a private type is always passed by the mechanism
appropriate to the full view of the type.
</p>
<p>
   Note that tagged types, task types and protected types are by-
reference types.
</p>
<p>
   A similar approach is taken with function results.  Certain types are
classified as return-by-reference types.  Again these include task types
and protected types (and most other limited types, see 7.3).  In the case
of a result returned by reference the function call denotes a constant
view of the object denoted by the return expression.  In other cases a
copy is made.  Remember that the result of a function call is treated as
an object in Ada 95.
</p>
<p>
   A difference between parameters and results is that tagged types are
always by reference as parameters but only returned by reference if
limited.
</p>
<p>
   For all modes and both mechanisms of parameters and for results, a
subtype conversion is performed if necessary (to provide sliding).
</p>
<p>
   Note in particular that sliding is used for array parameters and
results whereas Ada 83 required the more restrictive exact matching of
bounds.  An array aggregate with others is still allowed as a parameter
or as a result and with the same meaning although for different reasons.
In Ada 83 it was allowed because the matching rules provide the bounds
whereas in Ada 95 it is allowed because the rules for others in
assignment are relaxed but there is the overriding rule that aggregates
with others never slide.
</p>
<p>
   In Ada 95 it is not erroneous to depend on the parameter passing
mechanism (by-reference versus by-copy) for those types that allow both,
though it is nonportable.  This is an example of reducing totally
unpredictable behavior (see 1.3).
</p>

<h3>
<a name=1-1>
6.1.1  Out Parameters
</a>
</h3>

<p>
In Ada 83 a formal parameter of mode out could not be read, even after
being initialized within the procedure.  This forced certain algorithms
to include a local variable just to accumulate a result and which was
then assigned to the out parameter.  Introducing such a local variable is
error prone, because the final assignment may be mistakenly omitted.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if an out parameter is passed to a second procedure to be
filled in, the value returned cannot be checked prior to returning from
the first procedure.
</p>
<p>
   For Ada 95, we have removed the restrictions on the use of out
parameters.  Specifying that a formal parameter is of mode out indicates
that the caller need not initialize it prior to the call.  However,
within the procedure, once the parameter has been initialized, it may be
read and updated like any other variable.  As with a normal variable, it
is an error to depend on the value of an out parameter prior to its being
initialized.
</p>
<p>
   The added simplicity and flexibility provided by removing the
restrictions on reading an out parameter allows many of the special cases
associated with out parameters to be eliminated, including the
restriction regarding their use with limited types.
</p>
<p>
   Safety is preserved by ensuring that a subcomponent does not become
"deinitialized" by being passed as an out parameter.  If any subcomponent
of a type passed by copy has default initialization, then the whole
object is copied in at the start of the call so that the value of such a
subcomponent is not lost as a result of a subprogram call during which no
assignment is made to the subcomponent.  But in practice records are
usually passed by reference anyway.
</p>

<h3>
<a name=1-2>
6.1.2  Access Parameters
</a>
</h3>

<p>
A formal in parameter may be specified with an access definition.  Such a
parameter is of a general access type that is totally anonymous (has no
nameable subtypes), but is convertible to other general access types with
the same designated subtype.  Access parameters are valuable because they
allow dispatching on access values; they are also convenient for use with
access discriminants; see 3.7.1.
</p>
<p>
   Access parameters are often an alternative to in out parameters
especially for tagged types.  Thus suppose we have a tagged type and an
access type referring to it and appropriate variables such as
<pre>
   type T is tagged
      record ...

   type Access_T is access T;

   Obj: T;

   Obj_Ptr: Access_T := new T'(...);
</pre>
plus subprograms taking parameters thus
<pre>
   procedure P(X: in out T);

   procedure PA(XA: access T);
</pre>
then within the body of both P and PA we have read and write access to
the components of the record.  Indeed because of automatic dereferencing
the components are referred to in the same way.  And since tagged types
are all always passed by reference and never by copy, the effect is much
the same for many situations.  For example dispatching is possible in
both cases.  However, there are a number of important differences.
</p>
<p>
   In the case of the in out parameter, the actual parameter could be Obj
or Obj_Ptr.all thus
<pre>
   P(Obj);  P(Obj_Ptr.all);
</pre>
whereas in the case of the access parameter, the actual parameter has to
be Obj'Access or Obj_Ptr.  Moreover in the former case the variable Obj
must be marked as aliased
<pre>
   Obj: aliased T;
   PA(Obj'Access);  PA(Obj_Ptr);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   Remember also that an actual parameter corresponding to an access
parameter cannot be null.  Moreover, accessibility checks for access
parameters are dynamic and the parameter carries with it an indication of
its accessibility.
</p>
<p>
   A vital difference is that a function cannot have an in out parameter
and so an access parameter is essential if we need a function.  We recall
from 4.4.1 that the alternative of a procedure with an out parameter
corresponding to the function result is not possible in some cases such
as where the result type is class wide and we do not know the anticipated
specific type.
</p>
<p>
   Other important considerations occur if we have a sequence of nested
calls.  Thus suppose we have other procedures Q and QA and that in their
bodies we wish to call the procedures P and PA with the parameter passed
on.  There are four possible combinations of calls to consider.  We have
<pre>
   procedure Q(X: in out T) is
   begin
      P(X);                  -- in out passed on to in out
      ...
      PA(X'Access);          -- in out passed on to access
   end Q;

   procedure QA(XA: access T) is
   begin
      P(XA.all);             -- access passed on to in out
      ...
      PA(XA);                -- access passed on to access
   end QA;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
All of these calls are legal.  The call of PA from within Q is legal
because formal parameters of a tagged type are considered aliased and
treated just like an aliased local variable.  Hence X'Access is allowed
but the accessibility level is that of a variable local to Q.  This means
that the accessibility level passed to PA indicates that Q.X is local to
Q and will not reflect the accessibility level of the original actual
parameter passed to Q (and of course that information was not passed to Q
anyway).
</p>
<p>
   In the reverse situation where QA calls P no accessibility information
is passed on.  Moreover, it should be noted that the parameter XA.all
creates a view of the original parameter and this view is passed on; no
local object is created.  Thus the information passed on is simply the
original "reference" minus the accessibility information.
</p>
<p>
   The uniform cases where Q calls P or QA calls PA are straightforward.
The parameter is passed on unchanged, in the first case there is no
accessibility information and in the second it is passed on intact.
</p>
<p>
   There is a lot of merit in using access parameters because they pass
the correct accessibility level and avoid the risk of an illegal program
or unexpectedly raising Program_Error when attempting a conversion to a
named access type.  For example, assuming T and Access_T are declared at
the same level as the procedures and that Q and QA are called with actual
parameter Obj or Obj'Access respectively, then it would be illegal to
write
<pre>
   Obj_Ptr := Access_T(X'Access);
</pre>
inside Q since the static accessibility check fails, whereas it is legal
to write the corresponding
<pre>
   Obj_Ptr := Access_T(XA);
</pre>
inside QA, and the dynamic accessibility check succeeds.
</p>
<p>
   Furthermore if we also had a procedure
<pre>
   procedure RA(XA: access T) is
   begin
      ...
      Obj_Ptr := Access_T(XA);
      ...
   end RA;
</pre>
in which a similar conversion is performed, then calling RA from Q by
<pre>
   RA(X'Access);
</pre>
results in raising Program_Error on the attempted conversion in RA
whereas calling RA from QA by
<pre>
   RA(XA);
</pre>
works successfully because the original accessibility level is preserved.
</p>
<p>
   However, remember that we can always use Unchecked_Access which avoids
the accessibility checks.  This would overcome the difficulties in the
above examples but of course the use of Unchecked_Access in general can
result in dangling references; the responsibility lies with the user to
ensure that this does not happen.
</p>

them and parameters of a named access type see 3.7.1.

<a name=2>
6.2  Renaming of Bodies and Conformance
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In Ada 95, we allow a subprogram body to be provided by renaming another
subprogram.  This is a great convenience in those many cases in Ada 83
where the programmer was forced to provide a body which simply called
some other existing subprogram.  In order that the implementation can be
just a jump instruction, the subprogram specification must be "subtype
conformant" with the body used to implement it.  Subtype conformance is
required because the caller sees only the subprogram specification, and
therefore has prepared the parameters, performed constraint checks, and
followed the parameter passing conventions determined by the
specification.
</p>
<p>
   Several different rules existed in Ada 83 governing matching between
subprogram specifications.  For the purposes of hiding the name of the
subprogram, only the types of the formal parameters and the result, if
any, were relevant (see [RM83 8.3(15)]).  For renaming and generic
instantiation, the modes also had to match (see [RM83 8.5(7)] and [RM83
12.3.6(1)]).  Between a specification and its body, syntactic equivalence
was required ([RM83 6.3.1(5)]).
</p>
<p>
   For Ada 95, in order to support access to subprogram types, and to
support the provision of a body by a renaming, an intermediate level of
matching is needed.  This intermediate level requires static subtype
matching, but allows formal parameter names and defaults to differ.
</p>
<p>
   To improve the presentation in Ada 95, the descriptions of these
various levels of subprogram matching are gathered into the section on
Conformance Rules [RM95 6.3.1].  Each level of matching is given a name
and they can be arranged in a strictly ascending order of strength as
follows
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Type conformance.   This is the matching that controls hiding.
<li>
Mode conformance.   This  is  the  matching  required  for  renaming  and
               generic formal subprograms.
<li>
Subtype conformance.     This is  the matching  required  for  access  to
               subprogram types, and for specifying a body via renaming.
<li>
Full conformance.   This is the matching required between the declaration
               and  body   of  a   subprogram,   and   between   multiple
               specifications of a discriminant part.
</ul>
<p>
   In addition to centralizing these definitions, we have also relaxed
the full conformance rules, in order to make them represent static
semantic equivalence, rather than syntactic equivalence.  This has the
effect of eliminating certain anomalies (such as the non-transitivity of
Ada 83 conformance), as well as being more natural for the programmer and
easier to implement.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=3>
6.3  Overloading of Equality and Inequality Operators
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In Ada 83, the "=" operator could be explicitly defined only for limited
types (other than via a devious method based on a curious loophole in
generic instantiation).  This restriction was justified largely on
methodological grounds.  However, experience with Ada has illustrated
several circumstances where it is very natural to provide a user-defined
equality operator for nonlimited types.  For example, within a three-
value logic abstraction, "=" should return either True, False, or
Unknown.  For vector processing, it is natural to define a component-wise
"=" operator for vectors, producing a vector of Boolean values as the
result.  In such cases, it is also important to be able to explicitly
define "/=", since it is not the simple Boolean complement of "=".
</p>
<p>
   In Ada 95, we allow "=" to be treated like any other relational
operator.  But note that when the result type of a user-defined "="
operator is Standard.Boolean, a complementary definition for "/=" is
automatically provided.  Explicit definitions for "/=" are also
permitted, so long as the result type is not Standard.Boolean.  A "/="
operator with a result type of Standard.Boolean may thus become defined
only as an implicit side-effect of a definition for "=".
</p>
<p>
   Of course, dispatching can occur on "=".  For example in the procedure
Convert in 4.4.3, the comparison in
<pre>
   while Temp /= Empty loop
</pre>
dispatches.  Typically the equality will be predefined but of course it
might not be.
</p>

<p>
Many of the changes in this chapter are consequences of the general
requirement
<pre>
     R2.2-C(1) - Minimize Special Case Restrictions
</pre>
discussed in [DoD 90 A.3]; this lists three examples which have been met
by this chapter.  They are the ability to redefine "=", the ability to
read out parameters and the use of sliding (array subtype conversion).
