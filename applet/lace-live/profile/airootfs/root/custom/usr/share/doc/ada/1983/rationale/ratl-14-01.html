<H2>CHAPTER 14: Exception Handling</H2>

<H3><a name="14.1">14.1 Introduction</a></H3>

The  ability   to  handle   error  situations  is  essential  for  the
reliability of real-time systems. In many cases, they must be designed
as systems  which should  never  halt.  This  definitely  requires  an
ability to  handle situations that, although rare, are quite likely to
happen given enough time.
<p>
This subject of exception handling has received considerable attention
over  the  years,  and  several  formulations  of  exception  handling
features  for   programming  languages   have  been  proposed.  For  a
presentation of  these  facilities  the  reader  is  referred  to  the
extensive accounts  given in  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Go  75]</a>  and  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Le  77]</a>.  The  solutions
proposed differ  mainly in the level of generality at which they treat
the concept of exception.
<p>
One family  of solutions  tends to  consider exception  handling as  a
normal programming  technique for  events that are infrequent, but are
not necessarily  errors. This viewpoint has been followed in <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[LMS 74]</a>,
<a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Go 75]</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[PW 76]</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Le 77]</a> and <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[GS 77]</a>. It means that when an exception
occurs it  is first  treated by an exception handler, and then control
may return  to the  point where  the exception occurred. It also means
that exception handling may be used to perform some repair actions and
thereafter to continue normal execution.
<p>
A second  family of  proposals tends  to restrict exceptions to events
that can  be considered  (in some  sense) as  errors or,  at least, as
terminating conditions. This means that when an exception is raised in
a given  sequence of  statements, their  execution will  be abandoned.
Control will  be passed  to an exception handler but will never return
to the point where the exception was raised. The handler may decide to
restart the  same sequence  of actions under better conditions, but it
will do so by a different invocation of these actions, not by a simple
resumption. This  second family  of solutions includes recovery blocks
<a href="ratl-BIB.html">[HLMR 74,  Ra 75]</a>  and a  proposal by Bron, Fokkinga, and De Haas <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BFH
76]</a>.
<p>
Naturally, what  is considered  as an  error is rather subjective, and
moreover the ability of a handler to reinvoke a subprogram that raised
an exception will permit the use of exception handling both for making
repairs and for the treatment of rare events. The problem domains that
can  be   addressed  by  the  two  families  of  solutions  are  hence
comparable; but  they require different underlying mechanisms and they
lead to different programming styles.
<p>
The exception handling facility provided in Ada belongs to this second
family. It provides a facility for local termination upon detection of
errors. It  has been  inspired by  the  Bron  proposal  and  has  some
similarities with the Bliss signal enable construct.
<p>
The  discussion   of  exception   handling  starts   with  an  overall
presentation, followed by examples that illustrate the main classes of
use. The  interactions between  exceptions and parallel processing are
then presented, and we conclude with a discussion of several technical
issues.
