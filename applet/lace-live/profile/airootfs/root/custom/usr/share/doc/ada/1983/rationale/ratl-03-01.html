<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.1">3.1 Simple Declarations: Variables and Constants</a></H3>

Variables  and   constants  are  declared  by  the  simplest  kind  of
declaration, called an object declaration; the general form is similar
to that used in Pascal but there are some differences.
<p>
A delicate  balance is  necessary in  the handling  of  variables  and
constants. Reliability  and security  demand that  the two concepts be
clearly separated.  On the  other hand  it is convenient if a variable
declaration can  be changed  into a  constant declaration  by  a  very
simple alteration  of the  program text.  Ada meets these two goals by
having two  distinct but  related forms  of declaration  for  the  two
concepts. Thus the following object declaration:
<p>
<PRE>    C :  constant  REAL :=  300_000.0;</PRE>
<p>
declares a constant, whereas the following object declaration declares
a variable with an initial value:
<p>
<PRE>    SPEED :  REAL :=  C/1500.0;</PRE>
<p>
The adjective  constant which appears in the declaration of a constant
states that  the value  of this  object must  not be altered after its
initialization. By  writing this  adjective, the  programmer expresses
his intent  in an  explicit manner  and requests the assistance of the
compiler in  forbidding attempts  to alter  the  value  -  whether  by
accident, by mistake, or deliberately.
<p>
Following <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol  68</a> however, the adjective constant does not mean that
the initial  value must  be known at compilation time (that is, in Ada
terminology, the initial value expression need not be static).
<p>
For example, a function to determine whether a given integer number is
prime may declare an upper bound on divisors:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>function PRIME(X :  INTEGER) return BOOLEAN  is
  UPPER_BOUND :  constant INTEGER  :=  INTEGER(SQRT(X));
begin
  ...
end PRIME;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
and clearly  the value  of this  upperbound, although  constant for  a
given call  of the  function, will  be computed in terms of the actual
parameter of the function, and hence dynamically.
<p>
Good programming style in Ada will systematically emphasize constants,
even for  short texts where the danger of accidental alterations would
be very  slight. For  example, an  Ada formulation  of  the  classical
procedure to  exchange the  values of two variables will emphasize the
fact that the temporary variable - OLD_LEFT - is indeed a constant:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>procedure EXCHANGE(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out INTEGER) is
  OLD_LEFT :  constant INTEGER  :=  LEFT;
begin
  LEFT    :=  RIGHT;
  RIGHT :=  OLD_LEFT;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
An initialization is required in the case of a constant. For variables
it is  allowed but not required. Allowing initialization of a variable
in its  declaration enables  one to  ensure that  the initial state of
variables is  well-defined. Furthermore, this avoids long sequences of
initialization assignment  statements, which  are  divorced  from  the
declarations and hence hard to locate.
