<H2>CHAPTER 13: Tasking</H2>

<H3><a name="13.4">13.4 Packages and Tasks</a></H3>

We conclude by emphasizing one strong distinction between packages and
tasks, despite their lexical similarity. The overall concept is that a
package is  passive and  provides the means for visibility control and
structuring, whereas  a task  is active  and provides  the  means  for
parallelism and synchronization.
<p>
In order  to emphasize  that a package is the main structuring tool, a
task cannot be generic, cannot be a library unit, and cannot appear in
a use clause.
<p>
A general  subsystem  might  thus  be  a  (possibly  generic)  package
containing tasks.  This general  structure has the advantage of giving
good control  over the  facilities provided. Thus protocols on the use
of  entries  may  be  enforced  by  encapsulating  their  calls  in  a
procedure.
