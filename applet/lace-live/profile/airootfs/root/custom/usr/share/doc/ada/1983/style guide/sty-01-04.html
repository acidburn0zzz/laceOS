<H3><A NAME="1.4">1.4     To The Software Project Manager</a></H3>

Technical management plays a key role in ensuring that the software produced 
in the course of a project is correct, reliable, maintainable, and portable. 
Management must create a project-wide commitment to the production of 
high-quality code; define project-specific coding standards and guidelines; 
foster an understanding of why uniform adherence to the chosen coding 
standards is critical to product quality; and establish policies and 
procedures to check and enforce that adherence. The guidelines contained in 
this book can aid such an effort.
<P>
An important activity for managers is the definition of coding standards for a 
project or organization. These guidelines do not, in themselves, constitute a 
complete set of standards; however, they can serve as a basis for them. A 
number of guidelines indicate a range of decisions, but they do not prescribe 
a particular decision. For example, the second guideline in the book 
(<a href="sty-02-01.html#2.1.2">Guideline 2.1.2</a>) advocates using a consistent number of spaces for indentation and 
indicates in the rationale that 2 to 4 spaces would be reasonable. With your 
senior technical staff, you should review each such guideline and arrive at a 
decision about its instantiation that will constitute your project or 
organizational standard.
<P>
Two other areas require managerial decisions about standardization. <a href="sty-03-01.html#3.1.4">Guideline 3.1.4</a>
advises you to avoid arbitrary abbreviations in object or unit names. You 
should prepare a glossary of acceptable abbreviations for a project that 
allows the use of shorter versions of application-specific terms (e.g., FFT 
for Fast Fourier Transform or SPN for Stochastic Petri Net). You should keep 
this glossary short and restrict it to terms which need to be used frequently 
as part of names. Having to refer continually to an extensive glossary to 
understand source text makes it hard to read.
<P>
The portability guidelines given in <a href="sty-07.html">Chapter 7</a> need careful attention. 
Adherence to them is important even if the need to port the resulting software 
is not currently foreseen. Following the guidelines improve the potential 
reusability of the resulting code in projects that use different Ada 
implementations. You should insist that when particular project needs force 
the relaxation of some of the portability guidelines, nonportable features of 
the source text are prominently indicated. Observing the Chapter 7 guidelines 
requires definition and standardization of project- or organization-specific 
numeric types to use in place of the (potentially nonportable) predefined 
numeric types.
<P>
Your decisions on standardization issues should be incorporated in a project 
or organization coding standards document.
<P>
With coding standards in place, you need to ensure adherence to them. Probably  
the most important aspect of this is gaining the wholehearted commitment of  
your programming staff to use them. Given this commitment, and the example of  
high-quality Ada being produced by your programmers, it will be far easier to 
conduct effective formal code reviews that check compliance to project  
standards.
<P>
Consistent coding standards work well with automatic tool support. If you have 
a tools group in your project or organization, they can be tasked to acquire 
or develop tools to support your standards. It is very cost effective to use 
tools to enforce standards. Where tools cannot be used to automatically modify 
code to conform to standards, they can often be used to at least check 
conformance.  See the automation notes sections associated with many of the 
guidelines.
<P>
Some general issues concerning the management of Ada projects are discussed by  
Foreman and Goodenough (1987).
