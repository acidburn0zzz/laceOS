<H2>CHAPTER 16: Input-Output</H2>

<H3><a name="16.8">16.8 Conclusion</a></H3>

We have  seen how  the general features of Ada can be used in order to
provide  flexible  and  convenient  input-output  facilities,  without
adding to  the syntactic  framework of the language itself in any way.
The following features have been particularly useful in doing this:
<ul>
<li>overloading of subprograms
 
<li>default parameters, including their dynamic evaluation
 
<li>limited types
 
<li>exceptions
 
<li>generic units, and especially the different formal types
 
<li>attributes of derived types
</ul>

This chapter has provided an excellent demonstration of the capability
of Ada as an application language. It illustrates that once a language
has an  adequate  richness  of  mechanisms  it  passes  some  kind  of
threshold, and  then effectively  becomes self-extending  and able  to
lend itself to varied domains of application, including such demanding
areas as input-output. Ada is the first real language to have achieved
this.
