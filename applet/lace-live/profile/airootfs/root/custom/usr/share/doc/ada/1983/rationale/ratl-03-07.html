<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.7">3.7 Statements</a></H3>

The classical  forms for  sequential processing  are included  in Ada:
assignment  statements,   procedure  call   statements,  if  and  case
statements, loop  statements, and  (control) transfer statements. Less
classical control  structures, such  as the  raise statement  and  the
statements used for tasking, are discussed in later chapters.
<p>
It is  customary to  distinguish simple  and  compound  statements:  a
simple statement  contains no other statement; compound statements may
include other sequences of statements.
<p>
The Ada  syntax is such that wherever a single statement may appear, a
sequence of  several  statements  may  also  appear.  This  simplifies
program modification  since insertion  of  a  statement  can  be  done
without the  need to  insert extra  begin and  end markers (as was the
case in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol and Pascal</a>).
<p>
A sequence  of statements  contains at  least one  statement: an empty
sequence is  not allowed.  For readability  reasons, Ada  provides  an
explicit null statement for situations where other languages would use
(implicit) empty  statements. For example, if nothing needs to be done
for a given alternative of a case statement, it is preferable to state
this explicitly by a null statement:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY is
  when TUE  | THU | SAT    =&gt; null;
  when MON  | WED |
       FRI  | SUN     =&gt; ACTION;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
rather than  convey the  same impression  by an  empty statement which
could be  taken  as  an  unintentional  omission,  as  in  the  Pascal
formulation given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case TODAY of
  TUE, THU, SAT : ;
  MON, WED,
  FRI, SUN: ACTION
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
