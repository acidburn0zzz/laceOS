<H2>CHAPTER 9: Packages</H2>

<H3><a name="9.1">9.1 Motivation</a></H3>

Packages allow  the programmer  to define  groups of logically related
items. They  cover a wide variety of uses, ranging from collections of
common declarations  to groups  of subprograms  and encapsulated  data
types.
<p>
The ability  to package  declared entities - such as variables, types,
subprograms, and  even other  packages -  provides  the  basis  for  a
powerful structuring  tool for  complex programs.  Moreover, a package
permits clear  separation between  information that  is usable  by the
rest of  the program,  and other  information that  must remain purely
internal to  the package.  The internal  information  is  hidden,  and
thereby  protected   from  deliberate  or  inadvertent  use  by  other
programmers. This  serves not  only to localize the effect of internal
errors to  the package  itself, but  also to make it easier to replace
one implementation  of (the services offered by) a package by another.
Packages are thus an essential tool for program modularity, supporting
program verification and information hiding as advocated by Parnas <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Pa
71]</a>.
<p>
Facilities for modularization have appeared in many languages. Some of
them -  such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Simula</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Clu</a>, and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Alphard</a> - provide dynamic facilities
which may entail large run-time overhead. The facility provided in Ada
is more  static -  in the spirit of previous solutions offered in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Lis</a>,
<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Euclid</a>, <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Mesa</a>, and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula</a>. At the same time it retains the best aspects
of solutions in earlier languages such as <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a> and <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Jovial</a>.
<p>
We shall  first discuss  packages informally by means of examples, and
then go on to discuss a number of important technical issues addressed
during the design of Ada.
