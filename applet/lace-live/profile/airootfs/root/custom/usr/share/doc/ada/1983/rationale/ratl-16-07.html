<H2>CHAPTER 16: Input-Output</H2>

<H3><a name="16.7">16.7 Low Level Input-Output</a></H3>

Low level  input-output facilities  are especially  needed in embedded
computer systems,  since signal  processing and  interaction with non-
standard  peripheral  devices  are  common.    Clearly,  major  system
dependences cannot  be avoided  in this area. At best the language can
provide a  set of  standard calling  conventions for  dealing directly
with peripherals.  The specific  device and  data descriptions  cannot
however be given.
<p>
Interaction with  peripheral devices  involves three  kinds of action:
starting an  operation on  a device,  interrogating the  status of the
device, and  waiting for  completion of  an operation.  The third case
can  be   dealt  with   by  the  entry  mechanism,  coupled  with  the
specification of  an  address  clause  that  links  the  entry  to  an
interrupt. The  first two cases, however, constitute requests from the
program. For  these, two  procedure names are introduced: SEND_CONTROL
to start  an operation, and RECEIVE_CONTROL to interrogate the status.
Each takes  two arguments:  DEVICE identifies  a particular peripheral
device, and  DATA  corresponds  to  the  information  that  should  be
exchanged with the device (hence DATA is an in out parameter).
<p>
For the  definition of such procedures we are faced with two problems:
efficiency and  generality. Efficiency dictates that an operation that
normally requires a small number of machine instructions should not be
surrounded by lengthy checks. This could be achieved by making the low
level primitives  built-in to  a given  compiler. However,  generality
requires  the  ability  to  write  the  appropriate  SEND_CONTROL  and
RECEIVE_CONTROL operations  whenever a  new device  is  added  to  the
system, without  forcing a  recompilation of the compiler. Hence these
operations cannot be built-in.
<p>
In order  to satisfy  these apparently  conflicting goals,  subprogram
overloading and  code statements  can be  used. As  many device  types
should be introduced as are required by the interfacing conventions of
the system.  Similarly, for  each device  type, appropriate data types
should be  introduced. For  each meaningful combination of device type
and  data   type,   overloaded   definitions   of   SEND_CONTROL   and
RECEIVE_CONTROL can  be given, and the corresponding subprogram bodies
may use appropriate code statements.
<p>
The general form of the package LOW_LEVEL_IO is as follows
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package LOW_LEVEL_IO is
  -- declarations of different device types
  -- declarations of different data types
    ...
  -- declarations of overloaded procedures for these types:
  procedure SEND_CONTROL (DEVICE  :  device_type;
                          DATA    :  in out data_type);
  procedure RECEIVE_CONTROL(DEVICE        :  device_type;
                          DATA    :  in out data_type);
    ...
end LOW_LEVEL_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Thus if  a user  needs to introduce a new device, then the appropriate
types and procedures can be added independently of existing ones; this
only requires recompilation of the package LOW_LEVEL_IO.
