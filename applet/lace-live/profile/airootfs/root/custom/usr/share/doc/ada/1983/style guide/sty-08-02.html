The following guidelines improve the robustness of Ada code. It is easy to 
write code that depends on an assumption which you do not realize that you are 
making. When such a part is reused in a different environment, it can break 
unexpectedly. The guidelines below show some ways in which Ada code can be 
made to automatically conform to its environment, and some ways in which it 
can be made to check for violations of assumptions. Finally, some guidelines 
are given to warn you about errors which Ada does not catch as soon as you 
might like.

To reuse software that uses named numbers and static expressions 
appropriately, just one or a small number of constants need to be reset and 
all declarations and associated code are changed automatically. Apart from 
easing reuse, this reduces the number of opportunities for error and documents 
the meanings of the types and constants without using error-prone comments.<P>

Unconstrained arrays can be declared with their sizes dependent on formal 
parameter sizes. When used as local variables, their sizes change 
automatically with the supplied actual parameters. This facility can be used 
to assist in the adaption of a part since necessary size changes in local 
variables are taken care of automatically.<P>

<H4>example</H4>
The following poorly written function documents, but does not check, its assumption:

   function Binary_To_BCD (Binary_Value : in     Natural)

automatic, and the comment unnecessary:

   function Binary_To_BCD (Binary_Value : in     Binary_Values)

The next example explicitly checks and documents its assumption:

      if Binary_Value &gt; Maximum_Representable then 
         raise Out_Of_Range;

<H4>rationale</H4>

Any part that is intended to be used again in another program, especially if 
the other program is likely to be written by other people, should be robust. 
It should defend itself against misuse by defining its interface to enforce as 
many assumptions as possible and by adding explicit defensive checks on 
anything which cannot be enforced by the interface.

<H4>note</H4>
You can restrict the ranges of values of the inputs by careful selection or  
construction of the types of the formal parameters. When you do so, the  
compiler-generated checking code may be more efficient than any checks you 
might write. Indeed, such checking is part of the intent of the strong typing  
in the language. This presents a challenge, however, for generic units where  
the user of your code selects the types of the parameters. Your code must be  
constructed so as to deal with <u>any</u> value of <u>any</u> type the user may choose to  
select for an instantiation.<P>

<li>Beware of using subtypes as type marks when declaring parameters or

</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
In the following example, it appears that any value supplied for the generic  
formal object Object would be constrained to the range <CODE>1..10</CODE>. It also appears  
that parameters passed at run-time to the Put routine in any instantiation, and 
values returned by the Get routine, would be similarly constrained.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   subtype Range_1_10 is Integer range 1 .. 10;

   generic
   
      Object : in out Range_1_10; 
      with procedure Put (Parameter : in     Range_1_10);

   package Input_Output is 
      ... 
   end Input_Output; 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
However, this is not the case. Given the following legal instantiation:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   subtype Range_15_30 is Integer range 15 .. 30; 
   Constrained_Object : Range_15_30 := 15;
   
   procedure Constrained_Put (Parameter : in     Range_15_30); 
   function  Constrained_Get  return             Range_15_30;
   
   package Constrained_Input_Output 
      is new Input_Output (Object =&gt; Constrained_Object, 
                           Put    =&gt; Constrained_Put, 
                           Get    =&gt; Constrained_Get);
                           
   ...</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
<CODE>Object</CODE>, <CODE>Parameter</CODE>, and the return value of
<CODE>Get</CODE> are constrained to the range  
<CODE>15..30</CODE>. Thus, for example, if the body of the generic package contains an  
assignment statement:<P>
<IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>Object := 1;</CODE><P>
<CODE>Constraint_Error</CODE> is raised when this instantiation is executed.

<H4>rationale</H4>
According to Sections <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-12-01.html#12.1.1">12.1.1</a>(5)
and <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-12-01.html#12.1.3">12.1.3</a>(5) of the
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983)</a>,
when constraint checking is performed for  
generic formal objects, and parameters and return values of generic formal  
subprograms, the constraints of the actual subtype (not the formal subtype or  
the base type) are enforced. <P>
Thus, even with a generic unit which has been instantiated and tested many 
times, and with an instantiation which reported no errors at instantiation 
time, there can be a run-time error. Since the subtype constraints of the 
generic formal are ignored, the Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of 
Defense 1983) suggests using the name of a base type in such places to avoid 
confusion. Even so, you must be careful not to assume the freedom to use any 
value of the base type because the instantiation imposes the subtype 
constraints of the generic actual parameter. To be safe, always refer to 
specific values of the type via symbolic expressions containing attributes 
like <CODE>'First</CODE>, <CODE>'Last</CODE>, <CODE>'Pred</CODE>, and
<CODE>'Succ</CODE> rather than via literal values.<P>
The best solution is to introduce a new generic formal type parameter and use  
it in place of the subtype, as shown below:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
generic 
   type Object_Range is range &lt;&gt;; 
   Object : in out Object_Range;
   
   with procedure Put (Parameter : in     Object_Range); 
   with function  Get  return             Object_Range;
   
package Input_Output is 
   ... 
end Input_Output; 
------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
This is a clear statement by the developer of the generic unit that no  
assumptions are made about the <CODE>Objects</CODE> type other than that it is an integer  
type. This should reduce the likelihood of any invalid assumptions being made  
in the body of the generic unit.<P>
For generics, attributes provide the means to maintain generality.  It is  
possible to use literal values, but literals run the risk of violating some  
constraint.  For example, assuming an array's index starts at one may cause a  
problem when the generic is instantiated for a zero-based array type.<P>

If the generic package shown in the example above is instantiated with <CODE>Integer</CODE> 
(or any subtype of <CODE>Integer</CODE>) as the actual type corresponding to generic formal 
<CODE>Value</CODE>, then the two <CODE>Put</CODE> procedures have identical interfaces,
and all calls to 
<CODE>Put</CODE> are ambiguous. Therefore, this package cannot be used with type <CODE>Integer</CODE>. 
In such a case, it is better to give unambiguous names to all subprograms. See

<H4>rationale</H4>
The effects of tasking becomes a major factor when reusable code enters the 
domain of real-time systems.  Even though tasks may be used for other 
purposes, their effect on scheduling algorithms is still a concern and must be 
clearly documented.  With the task clearly documented, the real-time 
programmer can then analyze performance, priorities, and so forth to meet 
timing requirements; or if necessary, he can modify or even redesign the 
component.<P>
Concurrent access to data structures must be carefully planned to avoid 
errors, especially for data structures which are not atomic
(see <a href="sty-06.html">Chapter 6</a> for 
details). If a generic unit accesses one of its generic formal parameters 
(reads or writes the value of a generic formal object or calls a generic 
formal subprogram which reads or writes data) from within a task contained in 
the generic unit, then there is the possibility of concurrent access for which 
the user may not have planned. In such a case, the user should be warned by a 
comment in the generic specification.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
On most occasions, an exception is raised because an undesired event (such as  
floating-point overflow) has occurred. Such events often need to be dealt with 
entirely differently with different uses of a particular software part. It is  
very difficult to anticipate all the ways that users of the part may wish to  
have the exceptions handled. Passing the exception out of the part is the  
safest treatment.<P>
In particular, when an exception is raised by a generic formal subprogram, the 
generic unit is in no position to understand why or to know what corrective 
action to take. Therefore, such exceptions should always be propagated back to 
the caller of the generic instantiation. However, the generic unit must first 
clean up after itself, restoring its internal data structures to a correct 
state so that future calls may be made to it after the caller has dealt with 
the current exception. For this reason, all calls to generic formal 
subprograms should be within the scope of a <CODE>when others</CODE> exception handler if 
the internal state is modified, as shown in the example above.<P>
When a reusable part is invoked, the user of the part should be able to know 
exactly what operation (at the appropriate level of abstraction) has been 
performed. For this to be possible, a reusable part must always do all or none 
of its specified function; it must never do half. Therefore, any reusable part 
which terminates early by raising or propagating an exception should return to 
the caller with no effect on the internal or external state. The easiest way 
to do this is to test for all possible exceptional conditions before making 
any state changes (modifying internal state variables, making calls to other 
reusable parts to modify their states, updating files, etc.). When this is not 
possible, it is best to restore all internal and external states to the values 
which were current when the part was invoked before raising or propagating the 
exception. Even when this is not possible, it is important to document this 
potentially hazardous situation in the comment header of the specification of 
the part.<P>
A similar problem arises with parameters of mode <CODE>out</CODE> or <CODE>in out</CODE> when exceptions  
are raised. The Ada language defines these modes in terms of &quot;copy-in&quot; and 
&quot;copy-back&quot; semantics, but leaves the actual parameter-passing mechanism 
undefined. When an exception is raised, the copy-back does not occur, but for 
an Ada compiler which passes parameters by reference, the actual parameter has  
already been updated. When parameters are passed by copy, the update does not  
occur. To reduce ambiguity, increase portability, and avoid situations where  
some but not all of the actual parameters are updated when an exception is  
raised, it is best to treat values of <CODE>out</CODE> and <CODE>in out</CODE> parameters like state  
variables, updating them only after it is certain that no exception will be  
raised.<P>
