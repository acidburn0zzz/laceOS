<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.3">3.3 Multiple Declarations</a></H3>

An object  declaration may declare more than one object, in which case
it is called a multiple object declaration. For example
<p>
<PRE>    DIVISOR, STEP :  POSITIVE  :=  5;
</PRE><p>
is a  multiple declaration  that declares  two  variables  of  subtype
POSITIVE which  are initialized  with the  value of  the literal  5. A
large number  of multiple  declarations are  of the  above  form:  the
initial value  is given  by a  literal or  by a  pure expression  that
delivers the  same value  each time  it is evaluated. But consider now
the multiple declaration:
<p>
<PRE>    YESTERDAY, TODAY, TOMORROW :  DAY  :=  GET_NEXT_DAY;
</PRE><p>
where the  function GET_NEXT_DAY  returns a different day each time it
is called.  Then there  are two  possible interpretations. One of them
would be equivalent to:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
some_day      :  constant DAY  :=  GET_NEXT_DAY;

YESTERDAY  :  DAY  :=  some_day;
TODAY      :  DAY  :=  some_day;
TOMORROW   :  DAY  :=  some_day;</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
in which  case all three variables would have the same value, obtained
by the  single evaluation  of the  function.  However,  the  semantics
selected for  Ada is  different. In  fact the  multiple declaration is
equivalent to the following sequence of single declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
YESTERDAY  :  DAY  :=  GET_NEXT_DAY;
TODAY      :  DAY  :=  GET_NEXT_DAY;
TOMORROW   :  DAY  :=  GET_NEXT_DAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
in this order. This means that the function will be called three times
and the variables will therefore be given three successive day values,
as one expects in the present example.
<p>
Clearly, the  two semantics  do not  differ  when  the  initialization
always yields the same value (the most frequent case). However we have
found that  when multiple evaluations yield different values, the most
natural  semantics   is  almost  always  the  one  involving  multiple
evaluations - hence the choice for Ada. Other examples are:
<p>
<PRE>    JOHN, PAUL :  PERSON_NAME  :=  new PERSON;
</PRE><p>
where we certainly want to allocate two new persons, and similarly:
<p>
<PRE>    FIRST, SECOND :  constant STRING  :=  GET_NEW_TEXT;
</PRE><p>
In this  last example  these two  constants may have different values,
and they  need not  even have  the same  length. Thus FIRST and SECOND
need not  even be  of the  same subtype  of the  type STRING. The same
situation would also arise with
<p>
<PRE>    A, B :  STRING(1 .. F)  :=  (others =&gt; "&#42;");
</PRE><p>
if F  were a  function and  the  two  implied  calls  of  F  delivered
different values.
<p>
In later  chapters, when  we discuss  default expressions  for  record
components and  for parameters,  we will  see that  the Ada  semantics
requires dynamic evaluation of these default expressions - as the need
arises; this  is quite  consistent  with  the  semantics  of  multiple
evaluation selected for multiple declarations.
