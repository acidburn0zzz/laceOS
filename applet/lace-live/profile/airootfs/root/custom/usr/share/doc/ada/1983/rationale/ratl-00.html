<h2><a name="about_html">About This HTML Version</a></h2>
<h3>Creation</h3>
This HTML document was derived from an ASCII version using both automatic and manual formatting. The ASCII-format original was initially converted to HTML using the program HTML Markup 1.1 by Scott J. Kleper (<a href="http://htc.rit.edu/klephacks/markup.html">http://htc.rit.edu/klephacks/markup.html</a>). This was done primarily to preserve basic paragraph
formatting and to convert special characters to sequences compatible with HTML. Microsoft Word, augmented by QuicKeys macros, was used
for the final conversion and cross-linking.
<p>
<h3><a name="errors">Errors in Original</a></h3>
The ASCII version from which this HTML was derived
was apparently an export from a previous hypertext version
in Microsoft Help format.
The original hypertext could not be found.
<p>
During conversion a number of errors
involving one or two characters were found in the parent ASCII version.
The nature of some of these errors suggested that
the parent ASCII version had been subjected to a computer-to-computer
transfer without the benefit of error checking.
Other errors appear to have been introduced when the ASCII version
was "wrapped" indiscriminately, in some cases affecting the
syntactical correctness of examples.
Every effort was made to correct these errors where
the intended text was unambiguous; a very few remaining errors
were marked as such so as not to mislead the reader.

This document, the Rational for the Design of the Ada programming language, 
has evolved over a number of years.
<p>
 A first version appeared in 1978 as the Rationale for the Green programming 
language, and this was revised in 1979 at the time that Green was finally 
selected as Ada.  The purpose of these documents was to explain the 
motivation for the language design, and to justify and defend its position 
against the other competitive languages and the Ironman (later Steelman) 
requirements.  No corresponding document was written in 1980 when Ada was 
proposed as a standard, nor in january when Ada finally became both an ANSI 
and Military Standard.  The present version completes and revises a draft 
issued in January 1984 and which was the subject of public review.

The United States Department of Defense has included this errata sheet to 
clarify certain aspects and improve the accuracy of The Rationale for the 
Design of the Ada Programming Language as it was delivered to the Ada Joint 
Program Office by the authors.  No copyright is claimed in the clarification 
of the basic document.
