<H2><A NAME="8.6">8.6</A>.  The Package Standard  </H2>
<A HREF="lrm-08-05.html#8.5"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="lrm-08.html#8"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="lrm-08-07.html#8.7"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
The predefined types (for example the types BOOLEAN, CHARACTER and INTEGER)
are  the  types  that are declared in a predefined package called STANDARD;
this package also includes the declarations of their predefined operations.
The package STANDARD is described in <a href="lrm-C.html#C">Annex C</a>.  Apart  from  the  predefined
numeric  types,  the specification of the package STANDARD must be the same
for all implementations of the language. 
<P>
The package STANDARD  forms  a  declarative  region  which  encloses  every
library  unit  and consequently the main program;  the declaration of every
library unit is assumed to occur  immediately  within  this  package.   The
implicit  declarations of library units are assumed to be ordered in such a
way that the scope of a given library unit includes  any  compilation  unit
that  mentions  the given library unit in a with clause.  However, the only
library units that are visible within  a  given  compilation  unit  are  as
follows:   they  include  the  library units named by all with clauses that
apply to the given unit, and moreover, if the given  unit  is  a  secondary
unit of some library unit, they include this library unit. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
If  all  block  statements  of  a  program are named, then the name of each
program unit can always be  written  as  an  expanded  name  starting  with
STANDARD (unless this package is itself hidden). 
<P>
If  a type is declared in the visible part of a library package, then it is
a consequence of the visibility rules  that  a  basic  operation  (such  as
assignment)  for  this  type  is  directly visible at places where the type
itself is not visible (whether by selection  or  directly).   However  this 
operation  can  only  be  applied  to  operands  that  are  visible and the
declaration of these operands requires the visibility of either the type or
one of its subtypes.
