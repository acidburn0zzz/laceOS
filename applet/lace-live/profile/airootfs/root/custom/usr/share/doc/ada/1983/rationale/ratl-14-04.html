<H2>CHAPTER 14: Exception Handling</H2>

<H3><a name="14.4">14.4 Tasks and Exceptions</a></H3>

The exception  handling facility has so far been presented in terms of
sequential  programs,   and  the   concepts  presented  are  therefore
applicable within  a task  body. For  exception propagation there is a
difference with tasks: in contrast to what is done for subprograms, if
an exception  is not  serviced by  a handler  within a  task body, the
exception is  not further  propagated -  the task  execution is merely
completed.
<p>
Note that  if the  exception were  propagated to  the parent  task, it
would mean  that child tasks could interfere asynchronously with their
parent, and  it would  also mean  that these interferences could occur
simultaneously, with disastrous results.
<p>
We will  now consider  two  other  interactions  between  tasking  and
exception handling:
<ul>
<li>Exceptions raised during the activation of a task
<p>
<li>Exceptions raised during communication between tasks
</ul>

<H3><BR><a name="14.4.1">14.4.1 Exceptions During Task Activation</a></H3>

Consider a procedure that declares three local tasks, A, B, and C. The
actions performed  by the  procedure are  partially  subcontracted  to
these local tasks.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure PERFORM is
  task A;
  task B;
  task C;
  ...
begin
  -- activation of A, B, C, in parallel
  -- (1)
  ...
exception
  when TASKING_ERROR =&gt;
  ...          --  (2)
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The semantics  of  Ada  specifies  that  the  three  local  tasks  are
activated, in  parallel, after begin but before the first statement of
the procedure. This means that at (1) we can rely on the fact that all
three tasks are activated.
<p>
Consider now  what happens if the activation of one (or more) of these
tasks is  not started as a consequence of the raising of an exception.
It would  not make  much  sense  to  execute  the  statements  of  the
procedure, once  it is  known that  one of the basic preconditions for
its proper  operation is not satisfied. For this reason, the execution
of statements  of the  procedure is  not started,  and the  predefined
exception TASKING_ERROR  is propagated  at (1)  to be  handled by  the
exception handler at (2).
<p>
(By analogy, if A, B, and C were array declarations, the statements of
the procedure would not be executed if the elaboration of any of these
declarations raised  an exception.  The analogy  stops there  however,
since in  the case  of task  activation the exception is raised in the
statements, and  can be handled locally, whereas in the case of arrays
the exception  is raised in the declarative part and propagated to the
caller to be dealt with. Activation of a task behaves like an implicit
initialization statement - placed after begin.)
<p>
Note that  the exception  that is propagated at (1) does not depend on
what caused  the abandonment  of task activation. What matters for the
procedure is to know whether or not activations have succeeded. Should
one or  more of them have failed, it does not matter much whether this
is by  constraint violation,  or by  a numeric error: in any case some
other treatment is needed. This therefore is the justification for the
propagation of  the less specific exception TASKING_ERROR. By the same
reasoning, it does not matter much whether one, or more than one, task
failed to  be activated.  Hence a single exception is raised in either
case.

<H3><BR><a name="14.4.2">14.4.2 Exceptions Raised During Communication Between Tasks</a></H3>

When two  tasks are  attempting to communicate with each other, or are
engaged in communication, an abnormal situation arising in one of them
may have an effect on the other.
<p>
As a basis for discussing the various cases that may arise, consider a
task SERVER that provides the entry UPDATE:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
task SERVER is
  entry UPDATE(THIS :  in out ITEM);
end;

task body SERVER is
  ...
begin
  ...
  accept UPDATE(THIS :  in out ITEM) do
    -- statements for servicing the request
  end UPDATE;
  ...
end SERVER;</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
and another task called USER, having no entry at all:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
task USER;
task body USER is
  THING :  ITEM;
begin
  ...
  SERVER.UPDATE(THIS =&gt;  THING);
  ...
end USER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The first interaction to consider is what happens if the USER calls an
entry of the SERVER
<p>
<PRE>    SERVER.UPDATE(THIS =&gt;  THING);</PRE>
<p>
at a  time when  this called task has already completed its execution.
Clearly the  called task  will never  accept the entry call, and hence
there  is  no  point  in  letting  USER  (the  caller)  wait  forever.
Consequently the  exception TASKING_ERROR  is propagated to the caller
at the  point of  call: the  caller is  thereby informed that the call
cannot be accepted. For similar reasons, this exception is also raised
if the  called task  (SERVER) has not already completed its execution,
but proceeds to do so without encountering an accept statement for the
entry call.

<H3><BR><a name="14.4.3">14.4.3 Abnormal Situations in an Accept Statement</a></H3>

The other interactions to consider correspond to error situations that
may arise  while two tasks are engaged in a rendezvous. We distinguish
three possible error situations:
<ol>
<li>An exception is raised by the execution of the accept
   statement
<p>
<li>The called task (SERVER) is disrupted while executing
   the accept statement
<p>
<li>The caller  (USER)  is  disrupted  while  the  accept
   statement is being executed
</ol>

The first  situation corresponds  to the  usual error  situations. The
second and third cases are only possible if another task has issued an
abort statement. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
abort SERVER;   -- in the second case
abort USER;     -- in the third case
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Such a  statement, to  be used  only in  extreme  circumstances,  will
eventually cause completion of the aborted task; this will in any case
occur no  later than  when the  aborted task reaches a synchronization
point: a  point where  it causes  the activation  of another  task; an
entry call;  the start  or the  end of  an accept  statement; a select
statement; a  delay statement;  an  exception  handler;  or  an  abort
statement.
<p>
We next  analyze the  consequences of  each of these possible abnormal
situations, both  with respect  to the  task issuing  the  entry  call
(USER) and  with respect  to the  task containing the accept statement
(SERVER).
<p>
<H4>An exception is raised within an accept statement</H4>
<p>
Consider a  situation in  which an  exception, say  error,  is  raised
within the accept statement of SERVER:
<p>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
task body USER is           
  ...
  SERVER.UPDATE(            
     THIS =&gt;  SOME_ITEM);   
  ...
                            
  ...
                            
  ...
                            
end USER;                   

</pre></td><td><pre>
task body SERVER is

  ...


   accept UPDATE(THIS :  out ITEM) do   

    error

   end;
     ...
end SERVER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
From the  point of  view  of  the  caller,  the  accept  statement  is
analogous to  a procedure body that is executed when the corresponding
entry is  called. Hence  if an  exception is  raised (and  not handled
within the  accept statement  itself) it  should be  propagated at the
point of call of SERVER.UPDATE.
<p>
However, from  the point  of view of the task that contains the accept
statement, this  statement is a normal statement of its body. Hence if
an exception  is raised  within SERVER,  it should  be  handled  by  a
handler provided within that same task (outside the accept statement).
<p>
To summarize,  an exception raised within an accept statement (and not
handled there)  is propagated  both in  the calling  and in the called
tasks. Both tasks may provide handlers for the exception.
<p>
<H4>The called task is disrupted</H4>
<p>
A different  treatment must be employed if the called task (SERVER) is
aborted by  a third  task. In  this case  the caller  (USER)  must  be
informed that the entry call will never be completed: For this reason,
the exception  TASKING_ERROR is  propagated at  the point of the entry
call.
<p>
<H4>The calling task is disrupted</H4>
<p>
In this  case, the  called  task  (SERVER)  completes  the  rendezvous
normally: the called task is unaffected.
<p>
There are  good reasons  for this  dissymmetry of treatment. First, we
can expect  servers to be programmed in a more robust manner than user
tasks. Moreover  it is  important to ensure continuity of service, and
this would  not be  the case  if it were possible for a single unsound
user to  affect the  service to  all  user  tasks.  In  terms  of  the
implementation, this  means that the storage of an aborted task cannot
be reclaimed  before the  end of  the rendezvous: this is important if
the entry  has in  out or out parameters that are implemented by copy,
or parameters of any mode that are implemented by reference.

<H3><BR><a name="14.4.4">14.4.4 Example of Exceptions in a Rendezvous</a></H3>

The following  program fragment  shows a  task USER that starts a file
transfer that  is performed  asynchronously by  a  task  SPOOLER.  The
procedure OPEN  is used by SPOOLER to open the two files. If either of
the files  is invalid,  an exception is raised, possibly after closing
the other file.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
task SPOOLER is
  entry START_TRANSFER(SOURCE,  DESTINATION :  in STRING);
end;

task body SPOOLER is
  INPUT   :  FILE_TYPE;
  OUTPUT  :  FILE_TYPE;
  C       :  CHARACTER;

  procedure OPEN(SOURCE,  DESTINATION :  in STRING) is
  begin
    OPEN(INPUT,  MODE =&gt;  IN_FILE,  NAME =&gt;  SOURCE);
    begin
      OPEN(OUTPUT,  MODE =&gt;  OUT_FILE,  NAME =&gt;  DESTINATION);
    exception
      when NAME_ERROR =&gt;        -- also propagated to calling task
      CLOSE(INPUT);  raise;
    end;
  exception
    when NAME_ERROR =&gt;  raise;
  end;

begin
  loop
    begin
      accept START_TRANSFER(SOURCE,  DESTINATION :  in STRING) do
        OPEN(SOURCE,  DESTINATION);
      end;

      loop
        GET (INPUT,    C);
        PUT (OUTPUT,  C);
      end loop;
    exception
      when END_ERROR =&gt;           -- handled locally and not propagated
        CLOSE(INPUT);
        CLOSE(OUTPUT);
      when NAME_ERROR =&gt;  null;   -- restart main loop
      end;                        -- the calling task has also received this
  end loop;
end SPOOLER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Two forms  of input-output exceptions may be raised within the body of
the task  SPOOLER. The  exception END_ERROR is handled locally and not
propagated. The  exception NAME_ERROR  may be raised within the accept
statement for  the entry  START_TRANSFER. The  handler provided within
SPOOLER simply  prepares it  for another  iteration. In  addition, the
occurrence of  this second exception also has an effect on the calling
task USER.  The exception  is propagated  in that task where it can be
serviced by a local handler:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
task body USER is
  OLD_FILE :  constant STRING :=  "&gt;UDD&gt;PROJECT&gt;JAN";
  NEW_FILE :  constant STRING :=  "&gt;UDD&gt;PROJECT&gt;FEB";
begin
  ...
  begin
    SPOOLER.START_TRANSFER(SOURCE         =&gt;  OLD_FILE,
                           DESTINATION    =&gt;  NEW_FILE);
  exception
    when NAME_ERROR =&gt;
      -- do something on OLD_FILE and NEW_FILE
  end;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
