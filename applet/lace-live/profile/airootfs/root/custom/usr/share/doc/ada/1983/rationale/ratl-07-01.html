<H2>CHAPTER 7: Derived Types</H2>

<H3><a name="7.1">7.1 Introduction</a></H3>

The basic mechanisms for defining a new type are by enumeration and by
composition from  existing ones;  certain operations are automatically
introduced by  such definitions, for example the basic operations that
are inherent  in indexing,  component selection,  and the formation of
aggregates. Another  way of  defining a  type is by means of a private
type declaration.
<p>
A third  possibility is  provided by the language: A type COPY is said
to derive  its characteristics  from those  of another  existing  type
MODEL if it is declared as
<p>
<PRE>    type COPY is new MODEL;</PRE>
<p>
This form of declaration is useful whenever a type is to have the same
characteristics as  another type, (and possibly some additional ones).
The type MODEL is said to be the parent type, and COPY is said to be a
derived type - derived from the parent type. Although the derived type
COPY and  its parent type MODEL have similar characteristics, they are
nevertheless distinct types.
<p>
The following topics are some of the major uses of derived types:
<ul>
<li>Simple strong typing

<li>The explanation of numeric types

<li>The ability to define new types that have numeric literals

<li>The construction of private types

<li>Achieving transitivity of visibility

<li>Change of representation
</ul>

After an  informal introduction to derived types, these major uses are
discussed in  what follows.  It will be shown that all these uses rely
on a  unique ability,  namely the ability to introduce a distinct type
with similar properties.
