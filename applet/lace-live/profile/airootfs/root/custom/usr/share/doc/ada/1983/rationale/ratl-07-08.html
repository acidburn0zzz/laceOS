<H2>CHAPTER 7: Derived Types</H2>

<H3><a name="7.8">7.8 Change of Representation</a></H3>

The design  of Ada adheres to the principle of a single representation
per type,  with the  consequence that  two types  must be  declared if
there is  a need  for two  different representations.  Again  in  this
situation, derivation  is used  to produce  a second  type that  is  a
logical copy  of its  parent type, the only difference between the two
types being the representation. Consider for example the parent type:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PARENT(D :  BOOLEAN  :=  TRUE) is
  record
    A :  INTEGER;
    case D is
      when TRUE  =&gt;
        U  :  INTEGER;
        V  :  INTEGER;
      when FALSE =&gt;
        W  :  REAL;
    end case;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
From a  logical point  of view,  derivation will produce a copy of the
parent type:
<p>
<PRE>    type COPY is new PARENT;</PRE>
<p>
This means  that COPY  and PARENT  have the same components, including
discriminants, and  components that  are declared  in variants. Having
two  types,  we  can  specify  two  (different)  representations;  for
example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
for PARENT use
  record
    -- a sparse representation that optimizes
    -- efficiency of access to components
  end record;

for COPY use
  record
    -- a compact representation
    -- to be stored on secondary storage
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For change  of representation  we can  exploit the  fact that  the two
types are derived from each other and use explicit conversion:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  C :  COPY;
  P :  PARENT;
begin
  READ_FROM_DISK(C);
  P :=  PARENT(C);      -- convert to PARENT form
  OPERATE_EFFICIENTLY_ON (P);
  C :=  COPY(P);        -- convert back to COPY form
  WRITE_TO_DISK(C);
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
or simply:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  C :  COPY;
begin
  READ_FROM_DISK(C);
  OPERATE_EFFICIENTLY_ON(PARENT(C));
  WRITE_TO_DISK(C);
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Aside from  derivation, there  is  actually  no  satisfactory  way  to
achieve this  change  of  representation.  Consider  for  example  the
alternative of  copying (whether  manually or  with text  editors) the
type definition of PARENT when defining the type COPY:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type COPY(D :  BOOLEAN  :=  TRUE) is
  record
    A :  INTEGER;
    case D is
      when TRUE   =&gt;
        U  :  INTEGER;
        V  :  INTEGER;
      when FALSE =&gt;
        W  :  REAL;
    end case;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
To achieve  change of  representation, we  must first realize that the
obvious idea - component-by-component assignment - will not work:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
P.D :=  C.D;       -- Illegal!
P.A :=  C.A;
case C.D is
  when TRUE =&gt;
    P.U :=  C.U;
    P.V :=  C.V;
  when FALSE =&gt;
    P.W :=  C.W;
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This is  the equivalent  of the  code that  will  be  generated  by  a
compiler for  the conversion  for change  of  representation.  But  it
cannot be  written directly  by the programmer since direct assignment
to a  discriminant is  not allowed:  discriminant values  may only  be
changed by  whole record  assignments. Therefore,  the solution to the
above problem is to write:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
case C.D is
  when TRUE =&gt;
    P :=  (TRUE, C.A, C.V, C.U);
  when FALSE =&gt;
    P :=  (FALSE, C.A, C.W);
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This solution  is wordy and again requires a manual copy of the record
structure;  it   is  therefore   likely  to  create  errors  (such  as
interchanging U  and V  above -  did you  spot it?).  Furthermore,  it
suffers from  the  maintenance  problems  that  are  inherent  in  any
solution that  requires text  duplication. Thus if the type definition
is ever  extended, corresponding  changes need  to be performed in the
above case  statement. Their  complexity - and hence the likelihood of
error - will increase with the size of the record type definition.
<p>
Note finally  that defining  the type  PARENT in a generic package and
creating copies  by generic  instantiation is  not a  solution to  our
problem: All  instantiations would  result in types that have the same
representation, and  conversions  between  such  types  would  not  be
available.
