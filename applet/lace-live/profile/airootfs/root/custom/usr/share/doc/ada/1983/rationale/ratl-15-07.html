<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.7">15.7 Interface with Other Languages</a></H3>

A limited  and  implementation-dependent  facility  for  machine  code
insertions has  been included  in Ada. This facility has the advantage
of clearly isolating the use of machine language. Furthermore, its use
is heavier  than direct  use of  an assembler:  the  facility  offered
should be  sufficient for cases where there is an actual need, but its
style will inhibit overuse.
<p>
Each machine  instruction appears  as a  code statement,  which  is  a
record aggregate  of a  record type  that  defines  the  corresponding
instruction. Such  record definitions will generally be available in a
system-dependent library  package called  MACHINE_CODE.  This  package
must also  contain the representation of the record that describes the
machine instruction  format. Code  statements  may  be  used  only  in
procedures whose bodies consist entirely of code statements.
<p>
The following  example illustrates  the  use  of  a  set  system  mask
instruction on  an IBM  370. The  package  MACHINE_CODE  could  be  as
follows
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package MACHINE_CODE is
  type REGISTER    is range 0 .. 16#F#;
  type DISPLACEMENT   is range 0 .. 16#FFF#;
  type OPCODE      is ( ... , SSM, ... );

  type RR is ...
  type RX is ...
  type SI is
    record
      CODE  :  OPCODE;
      B     :  REGISTER;
      D     :  DISPLACEMENT;
    end record;
  ...
  for OPCODE use ( ... , SSM =&gt;  16#80#, ... );
  ...
  for SI use
    record
      CODE at 0 range 0 .. 7;
      B    at 0 range 16 .. 19; -- bits 8 .. 15 unused
      D    at 0 range 20 .. 31;
    end record;
  ...
end MACHINE_CODE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
We will  assume in  what follows that the set system mask operation is
defined as part of a package, along with similar operations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package SPECIAL_COMMANDS is
  ...
  procedure SET_SYSTEM_MASK(X :  MASK);
  pragma INLINE(SET_SYSTEM_MASK);
  ...
end;
with MACHINE_CODE;
package body SPECIAL_COMMANDS is
  ...
  procedure SET_SYSTEM_MASK(X :  MASK) is
    use MACHINE_CODE;
  begin
    SI'(CODE =&gt;  SSM,  B =&gt;  X'BASE_REG,  D =&gt;  X'DISP);
  end;
  ...
end SPECIAL_COMMANDS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For the body of this package, a with clause mentioning MACHINE_CODE is
required: this  rule will  enable programming  support environments to
enforce certain  management rules  concerning the  use of machine code
insertions. This  example also  shows the  need to use implementation-
specific predefined  attributes in code statements, such as X'BASE_REG
(the base  register used  for X)  and X'DISP  (the displacement of X).
Additional implementation-specific  pragmas may  be needed  to specify
the register and linkage conventions.
<p>
Obviously such  pragmas cannot  be machine-independent; the only order
that may  be brought  by a  high level language to such a matter is to
standardize the  conventions to  be used  for such specifications, and
this is  what we  achieve in  Ada by  recourse  to  pragmas.  Finally,
pragmas can  also be  used to specify that a subprogram called from an
Ada program  is written  in another language. Consider for example the
reuse of  functions defined  in  the  Fortran  library,  from  an  Ada
program. To achieve this, we declare a package
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package FORTRAN_LIB is
  function SQRT  (X :  FLOAT) return FLOAT;
  function EXP (X :  FLOAT) return FLOAT;
  ...
private
  pragma INTERFACE(FORTRAN, SQRT);
  pragma INTERFACE(FORTRAN, EXP);
  ...
end FORTRAN_LIB;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For each function needed we have declared an Ada function in the usual
manner, and  this function  can then  be called  using the  normal Ada
syntax. However,  the bodies of these functions are not written in Ada
and we  indicate this  by INTERFACE pragmas. These inform the compiler
about the  corresponding linkage  conventions, and  also to expect the
object code  to be provided later (at linkage editing time). Of course
compilers may  impose restrictions  on the form of parameters that are
allowed (for  example, passing  two-dimensional arrays may be complex,
given the  internal representation used by Fortran). Not all compilers
need provide this machine code insertion capability.
