<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.1">15.1 The Separation Principle</a></H3>

The treatment  of representation  in Ada  is  done  according  to  the
separation principle discussed below.
<p>
Data type definitions are performed in two steps:
<ol>
<li>The logical  properties of the data are defined. They
   describe all  the properties  that programmers  need to  know.  All
   algorithms are  formulated in terms of these logical properties and
   are not based on knowledge of the representation.
<p>
<li>The  representation  (implementation)  properties  of
   data are  either explicitly  specified by the programmer or, in the
   usual case, chosen by default by the compiler.
</ol>

There are  many advantages in this separation. The most fundamental is
the conceptual  simplicity of  formulating an  algorithm in  terms  of
abstract  properties.  The  ability  to  abstract  from  a  particular
representation leads to clearer and better structured programs.
<p>
Furthermore, to  establish the  correctness of  a program  that uses a
given formulation  of data  and a  given representation,  we have  two
disjoint proofs.  First we  show that the program is correct given the
formulation of  the data  types and  algorithms. Then we show that the
chosen representation  is a  correct implementation  of the  data. The
separation also  ensures that  users do  not make implicit assumptions
about the representation of data.
<p>
If at  a later  stage a  different  representation  is  selected,  for
example to  reduce storage  space, the  formulation of  the algorithms
need not  be modified.  Conversely, if the algorithms of a program are
modified, the representation need not be affected.
<p>
Another  advantage   is  textual   simplicity.  In   some  cases,  the
representation of  a data  type is dictated by external considerations
such as  the form  of a  hardware interface:  the description  of  the
representation  may  then  be  correspondingly  complex.  However,  by
keeping the  logical description  textually distinct  from that of the
representation  we   can  retain   the  simplicity   of  the   logical
description.
<p>
The above  separation principle is reflected in Ada by a clear textual
separation between  the declaration  of the logical properties of data
and the  specification of  the  properties  of  their  representation.
Properties of  the  representation  are  specified  by  representation
clauses. These clauses are optional, and distinct from the declaration
of the  logical properties.  The parts of a program that are hardware-
specific are thus easy to identify.
