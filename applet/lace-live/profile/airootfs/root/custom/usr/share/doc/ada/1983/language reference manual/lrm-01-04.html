<P>
An  Ada  program  is  composed of one or more program units.  These program
units can be compiled separately.  Program units may be subprograms  (which
define  executable  algorithms), package units (which define collections of
entities), task units (which  define  parallel  computations),  or  generic
units  (which  define  parameterized  forms  of  packages and subprograms).
Each unit normally consists of two parts:  a specification, containing  the
information that must be visible to other units, and a body, containing the
implementation details, which need not be visible to other units. 
<P>
This  distinction of the specification and body, and the ability to compile
units separately, allows a program to be designed, written, and tested as a
set of largely independent software components.   
<P>
An Ada program will normally make use of a  library  of  program  units  of
general   utility.    The   language   provides  means  whereby  individual
organizations can construct their own libraries.  The text of a  separately
compiled program unit must name the library units it requires.

<H4>Program Units</H4>

A  subprogram is the basic unit for expressing an algorithm.  There are two
kinds of subprograms:  procedures and functions.  A procedure is the  means
of  invoking  a  series  of actions.  For example, it may read data, update
variables, or produce some output.  It may have parameters,  to  provide  a
controlled means of passing information between the procedure and the point
of call.                                            
<P>
A  function  is  the  means  of invoking the computation of a value.  It is   
similar to a procedure, but in addition will return a result. 
<P>
A package is the basic unit for defining a collection of logically  related
entities.   For  example,  a package can be used to define a common pool of
data and types, a collection of related  subprograms,  or  a  set  of  type
declarations  and  associated  operations.   Portions  of  a package can be
hidden from the user, thus allowing access only to the  logical  properties
expressed by the package specification. 
<P>
A task unit is the basic unit for defining a task whose sequence of actions
may  be  executed in parallel with those of other tasks.  Such tasks may be
implemented  on  multicomputers,  multiprocessors,  or   with   interleaved
execution  on  a  single processor.  A task unit may define either a single
executing task or a task type permitting the  creation  of  any  number  of
similar tasks. 

<H4>Declarations and Statements</H4>

The  body  of  a  program unit generally contains two parts:  a declarative
part, which defines the logical entities to be used in  the  program  unit,
and  a  sequence  of statements, which defines the execution of the program
unit. 
<P>
The declarative part associates names with declared entities.  For example,
a name may denote a type, a constant,  a  variable,  or  an  exception.   A
declarative  part  also introduces the names and parameters of other nested
subprograms, packages, task units, and generic units  to  be  used  in  the
program unit. 
<P>
The  sequence  of statements describes a sequence of actions that are to be
performed.  The statements are executed  in  succession  (unless  an  exit,
return, or goto statement, or the raising of an exception, causes execution
to continue from another place). 
<P>
An  assignment statement changes the value of a variable.  A procedure call
invokes execution of a procedure after associating  any  actual  parameters   
provided at the call with the corresponding formal parameters. 
<P>
Case  statements  and  if  statements  allow  the  selection of an enclosed
sequence of statements based on the value of an expression or on the  value
of a condition. 
<P>
The  loop statement provides the basic iterative mechanism in the language.
A loop statement specifies that a sequence of statements is to be  executed
repeatedly  as  directed by an iteration scheme, or until an exit statement
is encountered. 
<P>
A block statement comprises  a  sequence  of  statements  preceded  by  the
declaration of local entities used by the statements. 
<P>
Certain  statements are only applicable to tasks.  A delay statement delays
the execution of a task for a specified duration.  An entry call  statement
is  written  as  a  procedure  call  statement;  it specifies that the task
issuing the call is ready for a rendezvous with another task that has  this  
entry.   The  called  task  is  ready  to  accept  the  entry call when its
execution reaches a corresponding accept  statement,  which  specifies  the
actions then to be performed.  After completion of the rendezvous, both the
calling  task and the task having the entry may continue their execution in
parallel.  One form of the select statement allows a selective wait for one
of several alternative rendezvous.  Other forms  of  the  select  statement
allow conditional or timed entry calls.                                                  
<P>
Execution  of a program unit may encounter error situations in which normal
program execution cannot continue.  For example, an arithmetic  computation  
may exceed the maximum allowed value of a number, or an attempt may be made
to  access  an  array component by using an incorrect index value.  To deal
with such error situations,  the  statements  of  a  program  unit  can  be
textually  followed  by  exception  handlers that specify the actions to be
taken when the error situation arises.  Exceptions can be raised explicitly
by a raise statement. 

<H4>Data Types</H4>

Every object in the language has a  type,  which  characterizes  a  set  of
values  and  a set of applicable operations.  The main classes of types are
scalar types (comprising enumeration and numeric types),  composite  types,
access types, and private types. 
<P>
An  enumeration  type  defines  an  ordered  set  of  distinct  enumeration
literals, for example a list of states or an alphabet of  characters.   The
enumeration types BOOLEAN and CHARACTER are predefined. 
<P>
Numeric  types provide a means of performing exact or approximate numerical
computations.  Exact computations use integer types, which denote  sets  of
consecutive  integers.   Approximate  computations  use  either fixed point
types, with absolute bounds on the error, or  floating  point  types,  with
relative  bounds  on  the  error.   The  numeric  types INTEGER, FLOAT, and
DURATION are predefined. 
<P>
Composite types  allow  definitions  of  structured  objects  with  related
components.   The  composite  types  in the language provide for arrays and
records.  An array is an object with indexed components of the  same  type.
A  record  is  an object with named components of possibly different types.
The array type STRING is predefined. 
<P>
A record may have special  components  called  discriminants.   Alternative
record structures that depend on the values of discriminants can be defined
within a record type. 
<P>
Access  types  allow  the construction of linked data structures created by   
the evaluation of allocators.  They allow several variables  of  an  access
type  to  designate  the  same  object,  and  components  of  one object to
designate the same or other objects.  Both the elements in  such  a  linked
data  structure  and their relation to other elements can be altered during
program execution. 
<P>
Private types can be defined in a package that conceals structural  details
that  are  externally  irrelevant.  Only the logically necessary properties
(including any discriminants) are made visible to the users of such  types. 
<P>
The  concept  of  a  type is refined by the concept of a subtype, whereby a
user can constrain the set of allowed values of a type.   Subtypes  can  be
used  to  define  subranges  of  scalar types, arrays with a limited set of
index values, and records and private types  with  particular  discriminant
values.    

<H4>Other Facilities</H4>

Representation clauses can be used to specify the mapping between types and
features  of an underlying machine.  For example, the user can specify that
objects of a given type must be represented with a given number of bits, or
that the components of a record are to be represented using a given storage
layout.  Other features allow the controlled use of low level, nonportable,
or implementation-dependent aspects,  including  the  direct  insertion  of
machine code. 
<P>
Input-output  is  defined  in  the  language by means of predefined library
packages.   Facilities  are  provided  for  input-output   of   values   of
user-defined   as   well   as  of  predefined  types.   Standard  means  of
representing values in display form are also provided.                                           
<P>
Finally, the language provides a  powerful  means  of  parameterization  of
program units, called generic program units.  The generic parameters can be
types  and subprograms (as well as objects) and so allow general algorithms
to be applied to all types of a given class.
