in another partition. The partition that originates the remote subprogram 
call is the <I>calling partition</I>, and the partition that executes 
the corresponding subprogram body is the <I>called partition</I>. Some 
remote procedure calls are allowed to return prior to the completion 
of subprogram execution. These are called <I>asynchronous remote procedure 
calls</I>.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal" Style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">There are three different

subprogram call in the calling partition; unmarshalling is done in the 
called partition. After the remote subprogram completes, marshalling 
is performed in the called partition, and finally unmarshalling is done 
in the calling partition.]</DIV>

<A NAME="I7782"></A>A <I>calling stub</I> is the sequence of code that 
replaces the subprogram body of a remotely called subprogram in the calling 
partition. A <I>receiving stub</I> is the sequence of code (the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;)

(Accessibility_Check)</I>}</SPAN> <A NAME="I7788"></A>In a remote subprogram 
call with a formal parameter of a class-wide type, a check is made that 
the tag of the actual parameter identifies a tagged type declared in 
a declared-pure or shared passive library unit, or in the visible part 
of a remote types or remote call interface library unit. <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>Program_Error

This check makes certain that the specific type passed<SPAN class="insert1">&nbsp;or returned</SPAN> in an RPC satisfies the rules for a &quot;communicable&quot; 
type. Normally this is guaranteed by the compile-time restrictions on 
remote call interfaces. However, with class-wide types, it is possible 
to pass an object whose tag identifies a type declared outside the &quot;safe&quot; 
packages.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">18.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">This is considered an accessibility_check since 
only the types declared in &quot;safe&quot; packages are considered truly 
&quot;global&quot; (cross-partition). Other types are local to a single 
partition. This is analogous to the &quot;accessibility&quot; of global 
vs. local declarations in a single-partition program.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">18.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">This rule replaces a rule from an early version 
of Ada 9X which was given in the subclause on Remote Types Library Units 
(now <A HREF="AA-E-2-2.html">E.2.2</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="AA-E-2-2.html">Remote 
Types Library Units</A>&rdquo;). That rule tried to prevent &quot;bad&quot; 
types from being sent by arranging for their tags to mismatch between 
partitions. However, that interfered with other uses of tags. The new 
rule allows tags to agree in all partitions, even for those types which 
are not &quot;safe&quot; to pass in an RPC.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV Class="Normal">The implementation of remote subprogram calls shall 
conform to the PCS interface as defined by the specification of the language-defined 
package System.RPC (see <A HREF="AA-E-5.html">E.5</A>). The calling stub

in which case Do_APC shall be used. On the receiving side, the corresponding 
receiving stub shall be invoked by the RPC-receiver.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">20.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Implementation Note:&nbsp;</B>One possible implementation

<DIV Class="paranum">20.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">The code for calls to subprograms declared in 
an RCI package is generated normally, that is, the call-site is the same 
as for a local subprogram call. The code for the remotely callable subprogram 
bodies is also generated normally. Subprogram's prologue and epilogue 
are the same as for a local call.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">20.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">When compiling the specification of an RCI package, 
the compiler generates calling stubs for each visible subprogram. Similarly, 
when compiling the body of an RCI package, the compiler generates receiving 
stubs for each visible subprogram together with the appropriate tables 
to allow the RPC-receiver to locate the correct receiving stub.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">20.d</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">For the statically bound remote calls, the identity

<DIV Class="paranum">20.f</DIV>
<UL Class="SmallBulleted"><LI TYPE=DISC>It allocates (or reuses) a stream

it is propagated by the RPC-receiver to the PCS, which handles the exception,

<DIV Class="Annotations">A value of a remote access-to-subprogram type

partition, an index to the package containing the remote subprogram, 
and an index to the subprogram within the package. The values of these 
components are determined at run time when the remote access value is 
created. These three components serve the same purpose when calling Do_APC/RPC, 
as in the statically bound remote calls; the only difference is that 
they are evaluated dynamically.</DIV>

<DIV Class="Annotations">For remote access-to-class-wide types:</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">20.r</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">For each remote access-to-class-wide type, a

<DIV Class="Annotations">Alternatively, a remote access-to-class-wide 
value can be represented as a normal access value, pointing to a &quot;stub&quot; 
object which in turn contains the information mentioned above. A call 
on any dispatching operation of such a stub object does the remote call, 
if necessary, using the information in the stub object to locate the 
target partition, etc. This approach has the advantage that less special-casing 
is required in the compiler. All access values can remain just a simple 
address.</DIV>

operation. This index and the index to the table (described above) are 
written to the stream. Then, the actual parameters are marshalled into 
the message stream. For a controlling operand, only the access value
