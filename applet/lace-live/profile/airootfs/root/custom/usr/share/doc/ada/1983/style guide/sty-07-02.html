<H2>CHAPTER 7: Portability</H2>

<H3><a name="7.2">7.2     Numeric Types and Expressions</a></H3>
A great deal of care was taken with the design of the Ada features related to  
numeric computations to ensure that the language could be used in embedded  
systems and mathematical applications where precision was important. As far as  
possible, these features were made portable. However, there is an inevitable  
tradeoff between maximally exploiting the available precision of numeric  
computation on a particular machine and maximizing the portability of Ada  
numeric constructs. This means that these Ada features, particularly numeric  
types and expressions, must be used with great care if full portability of the  
resulting program is to be guaranteed.

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li> Do not use the predefined numeric types in package <CODE>Standard</CODE>. Use range 
and digits declarations and let the implementation do the derivation 
implicitly from the predefined types. 
<li>For programs that require greater accuracy than that provided by the  
global assumptions, define a package that declares a private type and  
operations as needed; see Pappas (1985) for a full explanation and examples. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
The second and third examples below are not representable as subranges of  
<CODE>Integer</CODE> on a machine with a 16-bit word. The first example below allows a 
compiler to choose a multiword representation if necessary.<P>
Use<BR>
<pre>    type    Second_Of_Day is             range 0 .. 86_400;</pre>

rather than<BR>
<pre>    type    Second_Of_Day is new Integer range 1 .. 86_400;</pre>

or<BR>
<pre>    subtype Second_Of_Day is     Integer range 1 .. 86_400;</pre>

<H4>rationale</H4>
An implementor is free to define the range of the predefined numeric types. 
Porting code from an implementation with greater accuracy to one of lesser is 
a time consuming and error-prone process. Many of the errors are not reported 
until run-time.<P>
This applies to more than just numerical computation. An easy-to-overlook 
instance of this problem occurs if you neglect to use explicitly declared 
types for integer discrete ranges (array sizes, loop ranges, etc.) (see 
Guidelines <a href="sty-05-05.html#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>
and <a href="sty-05-05.html#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>).
If you do not provide an explicit type when specifying index 
constraints and other discrete ranges, a predefined integer type is assumed.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Any indexing into the predefined String type requires that the index at least  
be a subtype of the predefined Integer type.  The predefined packages also use  
the various predefined types.

<H4>note</H4>
There is an alternative which this guideline permits. 
As <a href="sty-07-01.html#7.1.5">Guideline 7.1.5</a> suggests, 
implementation dependencies can be encapsulated in packages intended for that 
purpose.  This could include the definition of a 32-bit integer type.  It 
would then be possible to derive additional types from that 32-bit type.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Know the Ada model for floating point types and arithmetic. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Declarations of Ada floating point types give users control over both the 
representation and arithmetic used in floating point operations. Portable 
properties of Ada programs are derived from the models for floating point 
numbers of the subtype and the corresponding safe numbers. The relative 
spacing and range of values in a type are determined by the declaration. 
Attributes can be used to specify the transportable properties of an Ada 
floating point type.<P>

<UL>
<li>Carefully analyze what accuracy and precision you really need. 
</UL>
rationale<P>
Floating point calculations are done with the equivalent of the  
implementation's predefined floating point types. The effect of extra &quot;guard&quot; 
digits in internal computations can sometimes lower the number of digits that  
must be specified in an Ada declaration. This may not be consistent over  
implementations where the program is intended to be run. It may also lead to  
the false conclusion that the declared types are sufficient for the accuracy  
required.<P>
The numeric type declarations should be chosen to satisfy the lowest precision  
(smallest number of digits) that will provide the required accuracy. Careful  
analysis will be necessary to show that the declarations are adequate.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Do not press the accuracy limits of the machine(s). 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The Ada floating point model is intended to facilitate program portability,  
which is often at the expense of efficiency in using the underlying machine  
arithmetic. Just because two different machines use the same number of digits  
in the mantissa of a floating point number does not imply they will have the  
same arithmetic properties. Some Ada implementations may give slightly better  
accuracy than required by Ada because they make efficient use of the machine.  
Do not write programs that depend on this.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use named numbers or universal real expressions rather than constants  
of any particular type. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
For a given radix (number base), there is a loss of accuracy for some rational 
and all irrational numbers when represented by a finite sequence of digits. 
Ada has named numbers and expressions of type universal_real that provide 
maximal accuracy of representation in the source program. These numbers and 
expressions are converted to finite representations at compile time. By using 
universal real expressions and numbers, the programmer can automatically delay 
the conversion to machine types until the point where it can be done with the 
minimum loss of accuracy.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Anticipate values of subexpressions to avoid exceeding the range of  
their type. Use derived types, subtypes, factoring, and range constraints on  
numeric types as described in Guidelines <a href="sty-03-04.html#3.4.1">3.4.1</a>,
<a href="sty-05-03.html#5.3.1">5.3.1</a>,
and <a href="sty-05-05.html#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The Ada language does not require that an implementation perform range checks  
on subexpressions within an expression. Even if the implementation on your  
program's current target does not perform these checks, your program may be  
ported to an implementation that does.<P>

abs X &lt;= abs X * Float_Type'Base'Epsilon       -- (4)</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Strict relational comparisons ( <CODE>&lt;</CODE>, <CODE>&gt;</CODE>,
<CODE>=</CODE>, <CODE>/=</CODE> ) are a general problem in real 
valued computations. Because of the way Ada comparisons are defined in terms 
of model intervals, it is possible for the values of the Ada comparisons
<CODE>A &lt; B</CODE> and <CODE>A = B</CODE> to depend on the implementation,
while <CODE>A &lt;= B</CODE> evaluates uniformly 
across implementations. Note that for real values in Ada,
&quot;<CODE>A &lt;= B</CODE>&quot; is not the 
same as &quot;<CODE>not (A &gt; B)</CODE>&quot;.
Further explanation can be found in Cohen (1986) pp.227-233.
<P>
Type attributes are the primary means of symbolically accessing the 
implementation of the Ada numeric model. When the characteristics of the model 
numbers are accessed symbolically, the source code is portable. The 
appropriate model numbers of any implementation will then be used by the 
generated code.<P>
Although zero is technically not a special case, it is often overlooked 
because it looks like the simplest and, therefore, safest case.  But in 
reality, each time comparisons involve small values, evaluate the situation to 
determine which technique is appropriate.<P>
note<P>
Regardless of language, real valued computations have inaccuracy.  That the  
corresponding mathematical operations have algebraic properties usually  
introduces some confusion.  This guideline explains how Ada deals with the  
problem that most languages face.<P>
