<H2>CHAPTER 9: Packages</H2>

<H3><a name="9.4">9.4 Summary and Conclusion</a></H3>

A simple  approach was taken for the package facility of Ada. Packages
provide the  ability  to  encapsulate  information.  When  defining  a
package, the  programmer simply  states the  visible  information  and
provides its implementation as a separate text - the package body. The
information contained  in a  package body  is not (directly) available
outside the package body. Thus, packages support information hiding as
well as control of visibility.
<p>
The package  facility is  central to  the definition  of private  data
types: it  provides complete control over the available operations for
such types.  Moreover, packages  can be  separately compiled  and  the
language also  provides a  parameterized form  of  package,  called  a
generic package.
<p>
All of  these aspects  are in  many respects  fundamental for  program
development. Packages  are  used  to  construct  libraries  containing
common pools  of data  and types,  application packages,  and complete
systems.
