<P>
The declaration of a type as a private  type  in  the  visible  part  of  a
package serves to separate the characteristics that can be used directly by
outside  program  units  (that  is,  the  logical  properties)  from  other
characteristics whose direct use is confined to the package (the details of
the definition of the type itself).  Deferred constant declarations declare
constants of private types. 
<pre>
    private_type_declaration ::=
       type identifier [discriminant_part] is [limited] private; 

    deferred_constant_declaration ::=
       identifier_list : constant type_mark; 
</pre>
<P>
A private type declaration is only  allowed as a declarative  item  of  the
visible  part  of  a package, or as the generic parameter declaration for a
generic formal type in a generic formal part.  
<P>
The type mark of a deferred constant declaration must denote a private type
or a subtype of a private type;  a deferred constant  declaration  and  the
declaration  of  the  corresponding  private  type must both be declarative
items of the visible  part  of  the  same  package.   A  deferred  constant
declaration  with several identifiers is equivalent to a sequence of single
deferred constant declarations as explained in section <a href="lrm-03-02.html#3.2">3.2</a>. 
<P>
Examples of private type declarations: 
<pre>
    type KEY is private;
    type FILE_NAME is limited private; 
</pre>
<P>
Example of deferred constant declaration: 
<pre>
    NULL_KEY : constant KEY;  
</pre>

<P>
If  a  private  type declaration is given in the visible part of a package,
then a corresponding declaration of a type with the  same  identifier  must
appear  as  a  declarative  item  of  the private part of the package.  The
corresponding declaration must be either a full  type  declaration  or  the
declaration  of  a task type.  In the rest of this section explanations are
given in terms of full type declarations;  the same  rules  apply  also  to
declarations of task types.                                                        
<P>
A  private  type  declaration  and  the corresponding full type declaration
define a single type.  The private  type  declaration,  together  with  the
visible  part,  define the operations that are available to outside program
units (see section <a href="#7.4.2">7.4.2</a> on the operations that are available  for  private
types).   On  the  other  hand,  the  full  type  declaration defines other
operations whose direct use is only possible within the package itself. 
<P>
If the private type declaration includes  a  discriminant  part,  the  full
declaration  must  include a discriminant part that conforms (see <a href="lrm-06-03.html#6.3.1">6.3.1</a> for
the conformance rules) and its  type  definition  must  be  a  record  type
definition.  Conversely, if the private type declaration does not include a
discriminant part, the type declared by the full type declaration (the full
type)  must not be an unconstrained type with discriminants.  The full type
must not be an unconstrained array type.  A limited type (in  particular  a
task  type)  is allowed for the full type only if the reserved word limited
appears in the private type declaration (see <a href="#7.4.4">7.4.4</a>). 
<P>
Within the specification of the package that declares a  private  type  and
before  the  end  of the corresponding full type declaration, a restriction
applies to the use of a name that denotes the private type or a subtype  of
the  private type and, likewise, to the use of a name that denotes any type
or subtype that has a subcomponent of the private type.  The  only  allowed
occurrences  of  such a name are in a deferred constant declaration, a type
or  subtype  declaration,  a  subprogram   specification,   or   an   entry
declaration;   moreover,  occurrences  within  derived  type definitions or
within simple expressions are not allowed. 
<P>
The elaboration of a private type declaration creates a private  type.   If
the  private  type  declaration  has  a discriminant part, this elaboration  
includes that of the discriminant part.  The elaboration of the  full  type
declaration  consists  of  the  elaboration  of  the  type definition;  the
discriminant  part,  if  any,  is  not  elaborated  (since  the  conforming
discriminant  part  of  the  private  type  declaration  has  already  been
elaborated). 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
It follows from the given rules that neither the declaration of a  variable
of  a  private  type,  nor the creation by an allocator of an object of the
private  type  are  allowed  before  the  full  declaration  of  the  type.
Similarly  before the full declaration, the name of the private type cannot
be used in a generic instantiation or in a representation clause.

<A HREF="#7.4.1"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="#7.4"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="#7.4.3"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
The operations that are implicitly declared by a private  type  declaration
include  basic operations.  These are the operations involved in assignment
(unless the reserved word limited appears in the  declaration),  membership
tests,   selected   components  for  the  selection  of  any  discriminant,
qualification, and explicit conversions.                                              
<P>
For a private type T, the basic  operations  also  include  the  attributes
T'BASE  (see  <a href="lrm-03-03.html#3.3.3">3.3.3</a>) and T'SIZE (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7.2">13.7.2</a>).  For an object A of a private
type, the basic operations  include  the  attribute  A'CONSTRAINED  if  the
private type has discriminants (see <a href="lrm-03-07.html#3.7.4">3.7.4</a>), and in any case, the attributes
A'SIZE and A'ADDRESS (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7.2">13.7.2</a>). 
<P>
Finally,  the  operations implicitly declared by a private type declaration
include the predefined comparison for equality and  inequality  unless  the
reserved word limited appears in the private type declaration. 
<P>
The  above  operations,  together with subprograms that have a parameter or
result of the private type and that are declared in the visible part of the
package, are the only  operations  from  the  package  that  are  available
outside the package for the private type. 
<P>
Within   the  package  that  declares  the  private  type,  the  additional
operations implicitly declared  by  the  full  type  declaration  are  also
available.    However,   the  redefinition  of  these  implicitly  declared
operations is allowed within the same declarative region, including between
the private type declaration and the corresponding  full  declaration.   An
explicitly  declared subprogram hides an implicitly declared operation that
has the same parameter and result type profile (this is  only  possible  if
the  implicitly  declared operation is a derived subprogram or a predefined
operator). 
<P>
If a composite type has subcomponents of a private  type  and  is  declared
outside  the  package  that  declares the private type, then the operations
that are implicitly declared by  the  declaration  of  the  composite  type
include  all operations that only depend on the characteristics that result
from the private type declaration alone.  (For example the operator &lt; is
not included for a one-dimensional array type.) 
<P>
If  the  composite type is itself declared within the package that declares
the private type (including within an inner package  or  generic  package),
then  additional  operations that depend on the characteristics of the full
type are implicitly declared, as required by the rules  applicable  to  the
composite   type   (for   example   the  operator &lt; is  declared  for  a
one-dimensional array type if the full type is discrete).  These additional
operations are  implicitly  declared  at  the  earliest  place  within  the
immediate  scope of the composite type and after the full type declaration. 
<P>
The same rules apply to the operations that are implicitly declared for  an
access  type  whose designated type is a private type or a type declared by
an incomplete type declaration. 
<P>
For every private type or subtype T the following attribute is defined: 
<ul>
<li> T'CONSTRAINED<br> 
Yields  the  value  FALSE  if  T  denotes  an   unconstrained
nonformal  private  type with discriminants;  also yields the
value FALSE if T denotes a generic formal private  type,  and
the associated actual subtype is either an unconstrained type
with  discriminants  or  an unconstrained array type;  yields
the value TRUE otherwise.  The value of this attribute is  of
the predefined type BOOLEAN.   
</ul>
<P>
Note:
<P>
A  private  type  declaration  and  the corresponding full type declaration
define two different views of one  and  the  same  type.   Outside  of  the 
defining  package  the characteristics of the type are those defined by the
visible part.  Within these outside  program  units  the  type  is  just  a
private  type  and  any language rule that applies only to another class of
types does not apply.  The fact that the full declaration  might  implement
the  private  type  with  a  type of a particular class (for example, as an
array type) is only relevant within the package itself.                                               
<P>
The  consequences  of  this  actual  implementation  are,  however,   valid
everywhere.   For  example:  any default initialization of components takes
place;  the attribute SIZE provides  the  size  of  the  full  type;   task
dependence rules still apply to components that are task objects. 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    package KEY_MANAGER is
       type KEY is private;
       NULL_KEY : constant KEY;
       procedure GET_KEY(K : out KEY);
       function "&lt;" (X, Y : KEY) return BOOLEAN;
    private
       type KEY is new NATURAL;
       NULL_KEY : constant KEY := 0;
    end; 

    package body KEY_MANAGER is
       LAST_KEY : KEY := 0;
       procedure GET_KEY(K : out KEY) is
       begin
          LAST_KEY := LAST_KEY + 1;
          K := LAST_KEY;
       end GET_KEY; 

       function "&lt;" (X, Y : KEY) return BOOLEAN is
       begin
          return INTEGER(X) &lt;            INTEGER(Y);
       end "&lt;";
    end KEY_MANAGER; 
</pre>
<P>
Notes on the example: 
<P>
Outside of the package KEY_MANAGER, the operations available for objects of
type KEY include assignment, the comparison for equality or inequality, the
procedure  GET_KEY  and  the  operator  "&lt;"; they  do  not include other
relational operators such as "&gt;=", or arithmetic operators. 
<P>
The explicitly declared operator "&lt;" hides the predefined operator "&lt;"
implicitly  declared  by the full type declaration.  Within the body of the
function, an explicit conversion  of  X  and  Y  to  the  type  INTEGER  is
necessary  to invoke the  "&lt;" operator of this type.  Alternatively, the
result of the function could be written as not (X &gt;= Y), since the operator
"&gt;=" is not redefined. 
<P>
The value of the variable LAST_KEY, declared in the package  body,  remains
unchanged  between  calls of the procedure GET_KEY. (See also the Notes of
section <a href="lrm-07-03.html#7.3">7.3</a>.)

<P>
If  a  deferred  constant  declaration  is  given  in the visible part of a
package then  a  constant  declaration  (that  is,  an  object  declaration   
declaring a constant object, with an explicit initialization) with the same
identifier  must  appear  as  a declarative item of the private part of the
package.   This object declaration is called the full  declaration  of  the
deferred  constant.   The  type  mark  given  in  the full declaration must
conform to that given in the deferred  constant  declaration  (see  <a href="lrm-06-03.html#6.3.1">6.3.1</a>).
Multiple  or  single declarations are allowed for the deferred and the full
declarations, provided that the equivalent single declarations conform. 
<P>
Within the specification of the package that declares a  deferred  constant
and before the end of the corresponding full declaration, the use of a name
that  denotes  the  deferred  constant  is  only  allowed  in  the  default
expression for a record component or for a  formal  parameter  (not  for  a
generic formal parameter). 
<P>
The elaboration of a deferred constant declaration has no other effect. 
<P>
The  execution of a program is erroneous if it attempts to use the value of
a deferred constant  before  the  elaboration  of  the  corresponding  full
declaration.
<P>
Note: 
<P>
The  full declaration for a deferred constant that has a given private type
must not appear before the corresponding full type declaration.  This is  a
consequence of the rules defining the allowed uses of a name that denotes a
private type (see <a href="#7.4.1">7.4.1</a>).

<A HREF="#7.4.3"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="#7.4"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A>
<P>
A limited type is a type for which neither assignment  nor  the  predefined  
comparison for equality and inequality is implicitly declared. 
<P>
A private type declaration that includes the reserved word limited declares
a  limited  type.   A  task  type is a limited type.  A type derived from a
limited type is itself a  limited  type.   Finally,  a  composite  type  is
limited if the type of any of its subcomponents is limited.    
<P>
The operations available for a private type that is limited are as given in
section <a href="#7.4.2">7.4.2</a> for private types except for the absence of assignment and of
a predefined comparison for equality and inequality. 
<P>
For  a  formal parameter whose type is limited and whose declaration occurs
in an explicit subprogram declaration, the mode out is only allowed if this
type is private and the subprogram declaration occurs  within  the  visible
part  of  the  package  that declares the private type.  The same holds for
formal  parameters  of  entry  declarations  and   of   generic   procedure
declarations.   The corresponding full type must not be limited if the mode
out is used for any such formal parameter.   Otherwise,  the  corresponding
full  type  is  allowed  (but  not  required)  to  be  a  limited  type (in
particular,  it  is  allowed  to  be  a  task  type).   If  the  full  type
corresponding  to  a  limited  private  type  is  not  itself limited, then
assignment for the type is available within the package, but  not  outside.                                          
<P>
The following are consequences of the rules for limited types: 
<ul>
<li>An explicit initialization is not allowed in an object declaration  if
the type of the object is limited.<br><br>
<li>A default expression is not allowed in a component declaration if  the
type of the record component is limited.<br><br> 
<li>An explicit initial value is  not  allowed  in  an  allocator  if  the
designated type is limited.<br><br> 
<li>A generic formal parameter of mode in must not be of a  limited  type. 
</ul>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The above rules do not exclude  a default expression for a formal parameter
of  a  limited  type;  they do not exclude a deferred constant of a limited
type if the full type is  not  limited.   An  explicit  declaration  of  an
equality operator is allowed for a limited type (see <a href="lrm-06-07.html#6.7">6.7</a>). 
<P>
Aggregates  are  not  available for a limited composite type (see <a href="lrm-03-06.html#3.6.2">3.6.2</a> and
<a href="lrm-03-07.html#3.7.4">3.7.4</a>).  Catenation is not available for a limited array type (see  <a href="lrm-03-06.html#3.6.2">3.6.2</a>). 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    package I_O_PACKAGE is
       type FILE_NAME is limited private; 

       procedure OPEN (F : in out FILE_NAME);
       procedure CLOSE(F : in out FILE_NAME);
       procedure READ (F : in FILE_NAME; ITEM : out INTEGER);
       procedure WRITE(F : in FILE_NAME; ITEM : in  INTEGER);
    private
       type FILE_NAME is
          record
             INTERNAL_NAME : INTEGER := 0;
          end record;
    end I_O_PACKAGE; 

    package body I_O_PACKAGE is
       LIMIT : constant := 200;
       type FILE_DESCRIPTOR is record  ...  end record;
       DIRECTORY : array (1 .. LIMIT) of FILE_DESCRIPTOR;
       ...
       procedure OPEN (F : in out FILE_NAME) is  ...  end;
       procedure CLOSE(F : in out FILE_NAME) is  ...  end;
       procedure READ (F : in FILE_NAME; ITEM : out INTEGER) is ... end;
       procedure WRITE(F : in FILE_NAME; ITEM : in  INTEGER) is ... end;
    begin
       ...
    end I_O_PACKAGE; 
</pre>
<P>
Notes on the example:    
<P>
In  the  example above, an outside subprogram making use of I_O_PACKAGE may   
obtain a file name by calling OPEN and later use it in calls  to  READ  and
WRITE.  Thus, outside the package, a file name obtained from OPEN acts as a
kind  of  password;   its internal properties (such as containing a numeric
value) are  not  known  and  no  other  operations  (such  as  addition  or
comparison of internal names) can be performed on a file name.                                                   
<P>
This  example is characteristic of any case where complete control over the
operations of a type is desired.  Such packages serve a dual purpose.  They
prevent a user from making use of the internal structure of the type.  They
also implement the notion of an  encapsulated  data  type  where  the  only
operations on the type are those given in the package specification.
