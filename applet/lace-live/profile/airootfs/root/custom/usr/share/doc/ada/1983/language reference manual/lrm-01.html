<H1><A NAME="1">1</A>.  Introduction   </H1>
<P>
Ada  is  a  programming  language  designed in accordance with requirements
defined by the United States Department of Defense:  the so-called Steelman
requirements.   Overall,  these  requirements  call  for  a  language  with
considerable  expressive  power  covering  a wide application domain.  As a
result, the language includes facilities  offered  by  classical  languages
such  as  Pascal  as  well  as  facilities  often found only in specialized
languages.  Thus the language is a modern  algorithmic  language  with  the
usual  control  structures,  and  with  the  ability  to  define  types and
subprograms.  It also serves the need for modularity, whereby data,  types,
and  subprograms  can  be  packaged.   It treats modularity in the physical
sense as well, with a facility to support separate compilation. 
<P>
In addition to these aspects, the language  covers  real-time  programming,
with  facilities to model parallel tasks and to handle exceptions.  It also
covers  systems  programming;   this  requires  precise  control  over  the
representation of data and access to system-dependent properties.  Finally,
both application-level and machine-level input-output are defined.
