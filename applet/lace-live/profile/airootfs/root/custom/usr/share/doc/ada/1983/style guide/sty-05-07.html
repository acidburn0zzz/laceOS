As noted in <a href="sty-04-02.html#4.2">Guideline 4.2</a>, Ada's ability to enforce information hiding and  
separation of concerns through its visibility controlling features is one of  
the most important advantages of the language. Subverting these features, for  
example by over liberal use of the use clause, is wasteful and dangerous. <P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Minimize using the use clause (Nissen and Wallis 1984). 
<li>Consider using the use clause in the following situations: 
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>Infix operators are needed 
<li>Standard packages are needed and no ambiguous references are introduced 
<li>References to enumeration literals are needed 
</UL>
<li>Consider the renames clause to avoid the use clause. 
<li>Localize the effect of all use clauses. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
This is a modification of the example from <a href="sty-04-02.html#4.2.3">Guideline 4.2.3</a>. The effect of a use  
clause is localized.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>... 
procedure Compiler is

   ... 
   package Listing_Facilities is 
   end Listing_Facilities;
   
   ... 
   package body Listing_Facilities is separate;
   
   ... 
end Compiler;

end Listing_Facilities;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
These guidelines allow you to maintain a careful balance between 
maintainability and readability.  Excessive use of the use clause may indeed 
make the code read more like prose text.  However, the maintainer may also 
need to resolve references and identify ambiguous operations.  In the absence 
of tools to resolve these references and identify the impact of changing use 
clauses, fully qualified names are the best alternative.<P>
Avoiding the use clause forces you to use fully qualified names. In large  
systems, there may be many library units named in with clauses. When  
corresponding use clauses accompany the with clauses and the simple names of  
the library packages are omitted (as is allowed by the use clause), references  
to external entities are obscured and identification of external dependencies  
becomes difficult. <P>
In some situations, the benefits of the use clause are clear.  The use clause 
can make several infix operators visible without the need for renames clauses. 
A standard package can be used with the obvious assumption that the reader is 
very familiar with those packages and that additional overloading will not be 
introduced.<P>
You can minimize the scope of the use clause by placing it in the body of a  
package or subprogram or by encapsulating it in a block to restrict visibility.

<H4>notes</H4>
Avoiding the use clause completely can cause problems with enumeration  
literals, which must then be fully qualified. This problem can be solved by  
declaring constants with the enumeration literals as their values, except that  
such constants cannot be overloaded like enumeration literals.<P>
An argument defending the use clause can be found in Rosen (1987).

<H4>automation note</H4>
There are tools that can analyze your Ada source code, resolve overloading of  
names, and automatically convert between the use clause or fully qualified  
names.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="5.7.2">5.7.2   The Renames Clause</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Rename a long, fully qualified name to reduce the complexity if it  
becomes unwieldy (<a href="sty-03-01.html#3.1.4">Guideline 3.1.4</a>). 
<li>Rename declarations for visibility purposes rather than using the use  
clause, especially for infix operators (<a href="#5.7.1">Guideline 5.7.1</a>). 
<li>	Rename parts when interfacing to reusable components originally 
written with nondescriptive or inapplicable nomenclature. 
<li>Use a project-wide standard list of abbreviations to rename common 
packages. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>procedure Disk_Write (Track_Name : in     Track; 
		      Item       : in     Data) renames 
   System_Specific.Device_Drivers.Disk_Head_Scheduler.Transmit;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
If the renaming facility is abused, the code can be difficult to read. A 
renames clause can substitute an abbreviation for a qualifier or long package 
name locally. This can make code more readable yet anchor the code to the full 
name. However, the use of renames clauses can often be avoided or made 
obviously undesirable by carefully choosing names so that fully qualified 
names read well. The list of renaming declarations serves as a list of 
abbreviation definitions (see Guideline ). By renaming imported infix 
operators, the use clause can often be avoided. The method prescribed in the 
Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983) for renaming a type 
is to use a subtype (see Guideline ). Often the parts recalled from a reuse 
library do not have names that are as general as they could be or that match 
the new application's naming scheme. An interface package exporting the 
renamed subprograms can map to your project's nomenclature.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="5.7.3">5.7.3   Overloaded Subprograms</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Limit overloading to widely used subprograms that perform similar  
actions on arguments of different types (Nissen and Wallis 1984). 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>function Sin (Angles : in     Matrix_Of_Radians) return Matrix; 
function Sin (Angles : in     Vector_Of_Radians) return Vector; 
function Sin (Angle  : in     Radians)           return Small_Real; 
function Sin (Angle  : in     Degrees)           return Small_Real;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Excessive overloading can be confusing to maintainers (Nissen and Wallis 1984, 
65). There is also the danger of hiding declarations if overloading becomes 
habitual.  Attempts to overload an operation may actually hide the original 
operation if the parameter profile is not distinct.  From that point on, it is 
not clear whether invoking the new operation is what the programmer intended 
or whether the programmer intended to invoke the hidden operation and 
accidentally hid it.

<H4>note</H4>
This guideline does not prohibit subprograms with identical names declared in  
different packages.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="5.7.4">5.7.4   Overloaded Operators</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Preserve the conventional meaning of overloaded operators (Nissen and  
Wallis 1984). 
<li>Use &quot;<CODE>+</CODE>&quot; to identify adding, joining, increasing, and enhancing kinds of functions.  
<li>Use &quot;<CODE>-</CODE>&quot; to identify subtraction, separation, decreasing, and depleting kinds of functions. 
</UL>
<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>function &quot;+&quot; (X : in     Matrix; 
	      Y : in     Matrix) 
      return Matrix;
      
... 
Sum := A + B;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Subverting the conventional interpretation of operators leads to confusing  
code.

<H4>note</H4>
There are potential problems with any overloading. For example, if there are  
several versions of the &quot;<CODE>+</CODE>&quot; operator, and a change to one of them affects the 
number or order of its parameters, locating the occurrences that must be  
changed can be difficult.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="5.7.5">5.7.5   Overloading the Equality Operator</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Do not depend on the definition of equality provided by private types. 
<li>When overloading the equality operator for limited private types,  
maintain the properties of an algebraic equivalence relation. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The predefined equality operation provided with private types is dependent on 
the data structure chosen to implement that type.  If access types are used, 
then equality will mean the operands have the same pointer value.  If discrete 
types are used, then equality will mean the operands have the same value.  If 
a floating point type is used, then equality is based on Ada model intervals 
(see <a href="sty-07-02.html#7.2.8">Guideline 7.2.8</a>.).<P>
Any assumptions about the meaning of equality for private types will create a  
dependency on the implementation of that type.  See Gonzalez (1992) for a  
detailed discussion.<P>
For limited private types, the definition of &quot;<CODE>=</CODE>&quot; is optional.  When provided,  
however, there is a conventional algebraic meaning implied by this symbol.  As  
described in Baker (1991), the following properties should remain true for the  
equality operator:

<table><tr><td><IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>-</CODE><IMG SRC="indent.gif">reflexive:</td><td><CODE>a = a</CODE></td></tr>
<tr><td><IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>-</CODE><IMG SRC="indent.gif">symmetric:</td><td><CODE>a = b ==> b = a</CODE></td></tr>
<tr><td><IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>-</CODE><IMG SRC="indent.gif">transitive:</td><td><CODE>a = b and b = c  ==> a = c</CODE></td></tr>
