<P>
Each  task  may  (but  need  not)  have a priority, which is a value of the
subtype PRIORITY (of the type INTEGER) declared in the  predefined  library
package  SYSTEM  (see  <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7">13.7</a>).   A  lower  value indicates a lower degree of
urgency;  the range of priorities is implementation-defined.  A priority is
associated with a task if a pragma 
<pre>
    pragma PRIORITY (static_expression); 
</pre>
<P>
appears in the corresponding task specification;  the priority is given  by
the  value  of  the  expression.   A  priority  is associated with the main
program if such a pragma appears in its  outermost  declarative  part.   At
most  one such pragma can appear within a given task specification or for a
subprogram that is a library unit, and these are the  only  allowed  places
for  this  pragma.   A  pragma  PRIORITY  has  no  effect if it occurs in a
subprogram other than the main program.    
<P>
The specification of a priority  is  an  indication  given  to  assist  the
implementation  in the allocation of processing resources to parallel tasks
when there are more tasks eligible for  execution  than  can  be  supported
simultaneously  by  the  available  processing  resources.   The  effect of
priorities on scheduling is defined by the following rule: 
<pre>
     If two tasks with different priorities are both eligible for execution
     and could sensibly be executed using the same physical processors  and
     the  same  other processing resources, then it cannot be the case that
     the task with the lower priority is executing while the task with  the
     higher priority is not.                                                       
</pre>
<P>
For  tasks of the same priority, the scheduling order is not defined by the
language.  For tasks without explicit priority, the  scheduling  rules  are
not  defined,  except  when such tasks are engaged in a rendezvous.  If the
priorities  of  both  tasks  engaged  in  a  rendezvous  are  defined,  the
rendezvous  is executed with the higher of the two priorities.  If only one
of the two priorities is defined, the rendezvous is executed with at  least
that  priority.   If  neither is defined, the priority of the rendezvous is
undefined. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The priority of a  task  is  static  and  therefore  fixed.   However,  the
priority  during  a  rendezvous  is  not  necessarily  static since it also
depends on the priority of the task calling the entry.   Priorities  should
be  used  only to indicate relative degrees of urgency;  they should not be
used for task synchronization.
