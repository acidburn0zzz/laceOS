<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.4">15.4 Presentation of the Data Representation Facility</a></H3>

The  language   provides  two   possible   degrees   of   control   of
representation. The first degree is provided by representation pragmas
such as  PACK. The  compiler is  merely provided with criteria for the
selection of  a representation:  the pragma expresses the intent only,
and the  program remains  portable. The  second degree  is provided by
representation clauses,  in which  case the compiler is left no choice
and must adopt the specified representation (if at all feasible).

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.1">15.4.1 Representation Pragmas</a></H3>

The pragma PACK is used to request a packed representation for objects
of the  type specified  by its argument. The use of this pragma is for
situations in  which we  try to  minimize the storage space of a given
composite type,  even at  the  cost  of  complicating  the  access  to
components; but  in which  the exact  mapping  used  by  the  compiler
remains unimportant.
<p>
Consider the  case of  an array  of a  given component  type. For each
component the  compiler must  allocate a  storage field with a certain
number of  bits. There  may also  be some  gaps (that  is, unused  bit
fields) between  two consecutive  components. The effect of the pragma
PACK is  to instruct  the compiler to minimize such gaps. For example,
to request  a packed  representation for  boolean matrices,  one would
write:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type BIT_MAP is array (1 .. 100, 1 .. 100) of BOOLEAN;
...
pragma PACK(BIT_MAP);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On the  other hand,  if the component type is itself a composite type,
it may  also contain  internal gaps:  these gaps are unaffected by the
packing specification  given for  the array type. Minimization of such
gaps could  be achieved by a prior packing specification given for the
component type itself.
<p>
The language  also provides  the representation  pragma OPTIMIZE, with
the argument values SPACE and TIME, to inform the compiler about which
of these  two criteria  is more  important in  a  given  part  of  the
program.

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.2">15.4.2 Length Clauses</a></H3>

The simplest  kind of  representation clause  is a  length clause. Its
form is as follows:
<p>
<PRE>    for representation_attribute use expression;</PRE>
<p>
where the  expression specifies  a value  for the given representation
attribute. For  example, it  is possible  to use  a length  clause  to
specify the  size to  be used  for objects  of a given type: for cases
where a  user wants  to optimize access time to frequently used record
components of  this type,  without having to specify the entire record
layout.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type NIBBLE is range 0 .. 15;
for NIBBLE'SIZE use 4;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For a fixed point type, a length clause can be used to specify exactly
the representation of the smallest representable value. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type WEIGHT is delta 0.01 range 0 .. 250;
for WEIGHT'SMALL use WEIGHT'DELTA;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Without  the  length  clause,  the  compiler  would  use  a  value  of
WEIGHT'SMALL that  was a power of 2 - in fact 1/128 - and this has the
advantage of  simplifying multiplications  by other fixed point types,
since rescaling  reduces to  shift operations. Should weights actually
be obtained  from a sensor for which a value of 2#0000 0000 0000 0001#
corresponds to  exactly a  centigram, then  the  above  length  clause
instructs the  compiler to use this representation - even if it causes
multiplications to be less efficient.
<p>
For task  types a  length clause can be used to provide an upper bound
for the  storage needed  by the  execution  of  a  corresponding  task
object; for  example, if  the task contains recursive procedure calls,
dynamic arrays,  or local  access types.  Note that such a clause does
not dictate the actual allocation strategy used for tasks: it could be
at the  time of  task activation  or at the time of elaboration of the
task declaration. The length clause only supplies information for this
allocation.
<p>
<PRE>    for LINE_TO_CHAR'STORAGE_SIZE use 200;</PRE>
<p>
For access  types, a  length clause  provides the  size of the storage
space to  be reserved  for all  dynamically allocated  objects of  the
designated type  (and of  any types  derived from  it). The collection
associated with an access type that has such a length specification is
allocated all  at once (upon elaboration of the representation clause)
and is reclaimed all at once, as for an array declaration given at the
place of  the access  type declaration.  Hence it  permits the  use of
access  types   with  their   notational  and   efficiency  advantages
(component selection  is cheaper  than array  indexing for  arrays  of
records) without  necessarily incurring  the potential costs of a more
dynamic allocation strategy. (See <a href="ratl-06.html#6">Chapter 6</a> for further explanation.)
<p>
To define sufficient storage space it is necessary to know the storage
size required  for one element. For a type T, the attribute T'SIZE can
be used  for this  purpose. For example the size of a collection large
enough to  contain approximately  400 dynamically allocated PLACEs can
be expressed as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PLACE;
type LIST is access PLACE;

type PLACE is
  record
    SUCC, PRED :  LIST;
    VALUE      :  INTEGER;
  end record;

for LIST'STORAGE_SIZE use
  (400 &#42; PLACE'SIZE) / SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The number  of dynamically  allocated records  is  only  known  as  an
approximation, since  the storage allocator may need some extra space,
and also because records with variant parts may not all be of the same
size.
<p>
A length  clause can  also be  used to achieve a biased representation
for an  integer type.  For example,  if we  have a  type ranging  from
10_000 to  10_127, any value of this type can be represented in only 8
bits (including  the sign bit). Specifying a length of 8 bits for this
type will  result in  the compiler  using a biased representation. For
example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type SKEWED is new INTEGER range 10_000 .. 10_127;
for SKEWED'SIZE use 8;
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.3">15.4.3 Record Representation Clauses</a></H3>

A record  representations clause  allows one  to specify the layout of
the components  of a  record type. This is done by giving the order of
the record  components, their  positions, and  their sizes in machine-
dependent terms. All the expressions included in such a representation
clause must  be static  expressions: their  values must  be  known  at
compilation time. A global alignment clause can also be specified.
<p>
<H4>Storage Units:</H4>
<p>
The storage unit is a configuration-dependent quantity that represents
the machine's  quantum of  storage. Its  value is  given by  the named
number SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT;  it is  the unit  of addressing implicitly
used to denote the position of a component.
<p>
<H4>Bit Ranges:</H4>
<p>
A bit  range is  used to  specify the position of a component inside a
storage unit. The two expressions in the range represent the positions
of the  first and  last bits  respectively. This  implies that the bit
ordering inside  a storage  unit must  be known  to the  user; such an
ordering is implementation-defined. The first bit of a storage unit is
always numbered 0. For example, the component clause:
<p>
<PRE>    SYSTEM_MASK at 0 range 0 .. 7;</PRE>
<p>
specifies that  the component  SYSTEM_MASK needs  8 bits  of  storage,
starting from  the beginning  of the  storage unit.  The storage  size
specified for  a component  must of  course be  large enough  for  the
component.  The  compiler  must  check  that  the  specified  size  is
compatible with the minimum needed for the representation of values of
the component type.
<p>
Bit numbering  may extend  through consecutive storage units; thus the
component clause:
<p>
<PRE>    PROTECTION_KEY at 0 range 8 .. 11;</PRE>
<p>
may be  legal, even  if the storage unit has eight bits on the machine
considered.
<p>
<H4>At Clauses:</H4>
<p>
The at  clause specifies  the position  of a  component by  giving the
position of  the storage  unit relative  to which  the  bit  range  is
counted. This position is itself relative to the first storage unit of
the record, which is numbered 0. For example,
<p>
<PRE>    TRACK at 2 range 0 .. 15</PRE>
<p>
means that the component TRACK occupies 16 bits starting with bit 0 of
the storage  unit numbered 2. If the value of SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT were
8, the  last bit  of TRACK  could actually  be bit  7 in  the adjacent
storage unit  numbered 3, depending on the implementation. Overlapping
components are allowed only when they belong to distinct variants, and
the compiler  must actually  check the  absence of overlap within each
variant. For  example, the  overlap of  LINE_COUNT and CYLINDER in the
following clause is legal because they belong to different variants:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DEVICE is (PRINTER, DISK, DRUM);
type PERIPHERAL(UNIT :  DEVICE :=  DISK) is
  record
    case UNIT is
      when PRINTER =&gt;
        LINE_COUNT :  INTEGER range 1 .. 50;
      when others =&gt;
        CYLINDER  :  CYLINDER_INDEX;
        TRACK     :  TRACK_NUMBER;
    end case;
  end record;

-- assuming SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT = 8 bits

for PERIPHERAL use
  record at mod 4;
    UNIT        at 0 range 0 .. 7;
    LINE_COUNT  at 1 range 0 .. 7;
    CYLINDER    at 1 range 0 .. 7;
    TRACK       at 2 range 0 .. 15;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
When the  record representation  clause is incomplete - that is, if it
does not  specify the layout for all components - the compiler is free
to map  the unspecified  components in any way that is consistent with
the logic  of the record type declaration. Compilers should be able to
produce listings of record mappings upon request.
<p>
<H4>Alignment Clauses:</H4>
<p>
When it  is important  that the  objects of  a given  record  type  be
allocated on  a given storage boundary, this can be specified by means
of an  alignment clause.  The alignment  is expressed  as a  number of
storage units,  and all  addresses at  which the objects are allocated
must be  exact multiples of the specified number of storage units (the
address modulo the alignment expression must be zero).
<p>
<PRE>    for PAGE_BUFFER use at mod 512;</PRE>

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.4">15.4.4 Address Clauses</a></H3>

An address  clause can  be used  to force the storage space of a given
variable to  be allocated  at a  given address,  which is specified in
storage units:
<p>
<PRE>    for TTY_STATUS_REGISTER use at 16#40#;</PRE>
<p>
This form of clause can also be used for specifying the address of the
code of  a subprogram, or to link an interrupt with a given entry. The
address given after the reserved word at has the system-dependent type
SYSTEM.ADDRESS (assumed to be an integer type in the above example).

<H3><BR><a name="15.4.5">15.4.5 Enumeration Representation Clauses</a></H3>

An enumeration representation clause is used to specify the mapping of
the values  of an  enumeration type  onto the  specific internal codes
used to represent the elements.
<p>
The mapping is specified using an aggregate in which the values of the
type are  enumerated one  by one.  The type  of such an aggregate is a
one-dimensional array  whose component  type is  universal_integer and
whose index  subtype is  the enumeration  type  itself.  For  example,
consider a  program that generates object code for a given machine and
in which  the operation  codes for  the  machine  are  defined  by  an
enumeration type.  It is  necessary to map the enumeration values into
actual operation codes and this can be achieved as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MIX_CODE is (ADD, SUB, MUL, LDA, STA, STZ);

for MIX_CODE use
  (ADD =&gt;  1, SUB =&gt;  2, MUL =&gt;  3, LDA =&gt;  8, STA =&gt;  24, STZ =&gt; 33);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In this example the array aggregate is of type
<p>
<PRE>    array (MIX_CODE) of universal_integer</PRE>
<p>
All enumeration  values  must  be  provided  with  distinct  universal
integer codes  and these  codes must  be known  at  compilation  time.
Moreover, in  order  to  get  an  efficient  implementation  of  order
relations, the  internal codes  must follow  the same  ordering as the
enumeration values.  The order  relations are  then known  through the
internal codes,  and there  is no  need for  the compiler  to generate
tables that contain the order relation.
<p>
As illustrated  above,  the  specified  internal  codes  need  not  be
successive integers.  We discuss the implications of this issue in the
next section.
