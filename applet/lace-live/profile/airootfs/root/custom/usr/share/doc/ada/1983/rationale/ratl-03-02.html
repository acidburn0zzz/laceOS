<H3><a name="3.2">3.2 Declarative Parts - Linear Reading</a></H3>

Object declarations  and declarations  of other  forms are  grouped in
declarative parts together with other declarative items such as bodies
(of subprograms and packages) and representation clauses.
<p>
The spatial  arrangement of declarative items in a declarative part is
(almost)  free.   This  means   that  constant   and  variable  object
declarations, and  type and  subtype  declarations  can  be  mixed  in
groupings that best reflect the logical needs of a program.
<p>
An Ada  program can  be read  linearly, line  by line  in a sequential
manner, very  much in the same way as we read good English prose. This
means that  our understanding  of  a  text  progresses  line  by  line
(declaration by  declaration) and that we can reuse in later lines the
knowledge acquired  in earlier  lines, as  is shown  in the  following
example where  each declaration  is made  in terms  of the  one on the
previous line:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>declare
  LENGTH  :  constant INTEGER  :=  100;
  SQUARE  :  constant INTEGER  :=  LENGTH&#42;LENGTH;
  subtype AREA is INTEGER range 0 .. SQUARE;
  SURFACE, EXTENT :  AREA;
begin
  ...
end</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Several rules  of the  language were designed to serve this purpose of
linear reading.  For example,  the scope  rules allow  declarations to
appear in  the  order  used  above.  But  they  would  not  allow  the
initialization of  SQUARE to  refer to  LENGTH if  the declaration  of
LENGTH were  given after  that of SQUARE: the Ada rules forbid forward
references: we  can refer  only to  what we  have already  read. Other
specific rules  that support  this linear  reading will be seen later,
when we discuss subprograms and access types (Chapters<a href="ratl-08.html#8"> 8 </a>and<a href="ratl-06.html#6"> 6</a>).
<p>
Reading is  linear and  so also is elaboration of declarations. During
program execution,  declarations are elaborated (that is, they achieve
their effect), one by one, in the linear order in which they appear.
<p>
For example, the constant LENGTH and the variable SURFACE do not exist
before the execution of the above block statement. This execution will
start by  the elaboration  of the  four  declarations  that  form  the
declarative part:  one after  the other. Thus after elaboration of the
declaration of  LENGTH, this  constant will  exist; but  the  variable
SURFACE will exist only after the elaboration of its declaration - the
last one.  Finally, after  executing the  statements enclosed by begin
and  end,   all  the  entities  created  by  the  elaboration  of  the
declarative part will disappear (or at least become unreachable).
<p>
The above  illustrates the  logical  model  of  execution  of  an  Ada
program. In  this model,  elaboration is  a process  that takes  place
dynamically, at  run time.  This does not, however, prevent a compiler
from  using  a  more  static  approach  -  for  example,  for  storage
allocation -  as long  as it  can guarantee  that this  implementation
technique will  yield an  effect equivalent  to that  of  the  logical
model.
<p>
The  only   limitation  imposed  by  the  language  on  the  order  of
declarative items is that bodies must appear after simpler declarative
items such  as object declarations. This rule was devised to avoid the
poor degree  of readability  that would  result from  mixing large and
small textual items. In <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol</a>-like languages that allowed this mixing,
the occurrence of an isolated variable between the bodies of two large
subprograms  was   a  well-known   source  of   error.  Although  good
programming practice  would avoid such isolated variable declarations,
they could  still be  generated by  faulty uses  of a  text-editor and
cause subtle errors when hiding outer declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  X :  INTEGER  :=  0;
begin
  ...
  declare
    ...               -- several procedures

    procedure P is    -- very long
      ...
    end P;
    X :  INTEGER;     -- a mistake: not legal Ada
    procedure Q is    -- also long
      ...
    end Q;
    ...               -- more procedures
  begin
    ...
    X :=  2;          -- should modify X ...
  end;
  if X =  0 then      -- but apparently did not!
    PUT("SOMETHING STRANGE is HAPPENING");
  end if;
  ...
end;</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
With the  Ada  rules,  the  declaration  of  a  variable  between  two
procedure bodies  is not  allowed and  therefore this  error  will  be
detected and  signaled by  the compiler.  Note that these rules do not
forbid a  local declaration  of X  hiding the outer one - there may be
good reasons  for such a declaration - but the hiding declaration will
have to  occur before  the bodies  and therefore  in a portion of text
that is easier to inspect than the potentially much longer text of the
sequence of bodies.
