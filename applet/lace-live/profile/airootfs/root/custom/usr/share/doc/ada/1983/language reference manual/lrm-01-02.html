<P>
This  reference  manual  contains  fourteen  chapters, three annexes, three
appendices, and an index. 
<P>
Each chapter is divided into sections that have a common  structure.   Each   
section  introduces  its  subject,  gives  any  necessary syntax rules, and
describes the semantics of the corresponding language constructs.  Examples
and notes, and then references, may appear at the end of a section. 
<P>
Examples are meant to illustrate  the  possible  forms  of  the  constructs
described.   Notes  are  meant  to  emphasize  consequences  of  the  rules
described in the section or elsewhere.  References are meant to attract the
attention of readers to a term or phrase having a technical meaning defined
in another section. 
<P>
The standard definition of the Ada programming  language  consists  of  the
fourteen   chapters  and  the  three  annexes,  subject  to  the  following
restriction:   the  material  in  each  of  the  items  listed   below   is
informative, and not part of the standard definition of the Ada programming
language:

<li>The examples, notes, and references given at the end of each section<br><br>
