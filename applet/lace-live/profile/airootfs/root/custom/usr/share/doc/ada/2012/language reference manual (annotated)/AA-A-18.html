This clause presents the specifications of the package Containers and 
several child packages, which provide facilities for storing collections 
of elements.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p1.a.1">1.a.1/3</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Glossary entry:&nbsp;</B>A container is an object 
that contain other objects all of the same type, which could be class-wide. 
Several predefined container types are provided by the children of package 
Ada.Containers (see <A HREF="AA-A-18-1.html">A.18.1</A>).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p2">2/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AIs/AI-20302.TXT">AI95-00302-03</A></I>} 
A variety of sequence and associative containers are provided. Each container 
includes a <I>cursor</I> type. A cursor is a reference to an element 
within a container. Many operations on cursors are common to all of the 
containers. A cursor referencing an element in a container is considered 
to be overlapping with the container object itself.<A NAME="I7329"></A> 
<A NAME="I7330"></A></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p2.a">2.a/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>The last sentence is intended 
to clarify that operations that just use a cursor are on the same footing 
as operations that use a container in terms of the reentrancy rules of 
Annex A.&nbsp;</div>

Within this clause we provide Implementation Advice for the desired average 
or worst case time complexity of certain operations on a container. This 
advice is expressed using the Landau symbol <I>O</I>(X). Presuming f 
is some function of a length parameter N and t(N) is the time the operation 
takes (on average or worst case, as specified) for the length N, a complexity 
of <I>O</I>(f(N)) means that there exists a finite A such that for any 
N, t(N)/f(N) &lt; A. <A NAME="I7331"></A><A NAME="I7332"></A></div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p3.a">3.a/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>Of course, an implementation 
can do better than a specified <I>O</I>(f(N)): for example, <I>O</I>(1) 
meets the requirements for <I>O</I>(log N).</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p3.b">3.b/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">This concept seems to have as many names as 
there are authors. We used &ldquo;Landau symbol&rdquo; because that's 
what our reference does. But we'd also seen this referred as big-O notation<A NAME="I7333"></A> 
(sometimes written as <I>big-oh</I>), and as Bachmann notation. Whatever 
the name, it always has the above definition.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p4">4/2</a></div>
<div class="Normal">If the advice suggests that the complexity should 
be less than <I>O</I>(f(N)), then for any arbitrarily small positive 
real D, there should exist a positive integer M such that for all N &gt; 
M, t(N)/f(N) &lt; D.</div>

When a formal function is used to provide an ordering for a container, 
it is generally required to define a strict weak ordering. A function 
&quot;&lt;&quot; defines a <I>strict weak ordering</I><A NAME="I7334"></A> 
if it is irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive, and in addition, if <I>x</I> 
&lt; <I>y</I> for any values <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>, then for all other 
values <I>z</I>, (<I>x</I> &lt; <I>z</I>) or (<I>z</I> &lt; <I>y</I>).</div>

This subclause provides a number of useful containers for Ada. Only the 
most useful containers are provided. Ones that are relatively easy to 
code, redundant, or rarely used are omitted from this set, even if they 
are generally included in containers libraries.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.b">5.b/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">The containers packages are modeled on the Standard 
Template Library (STL), an algorithms and data structure library popularized 
by Alexander Stepanov, and included in the C++ standard library. The 
structure and terminology differ from the STL where that better maps 
to common Ada usage. For instance, what the STL calls &ldquo;iterators&rdquo; 
are called &ldquo;cursors&rdquo; here.</div>

Separate versions for definite and indefinite element types are provided, 
as those for definite types can be implemented more efficiently. Similarly, 
a separate bounded version is provided in order to give more predictable 
memory usage.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.k">5.k/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">Each container includes a cursor, which is a 
reference to an element within a container. Cursors generally remain 
valid as long as the container exists and the element referenced is not 
deleted. Many operations on cursors are common to all of the containers. 
This makes it possible to write generic algorithms that work on any kind 
of container.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.l">5.l/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">The containers packages are structured so that 
additional packages can be added in the future. Indeed, we hope that 
these packages provide the basis for a more extensive secondary standard 
for containers.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.m">5.m/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">If containers with similar functionality (but 
different performance characteristics) are provided (by the implementation 
or by a secondary standard), we suggest that a prefix be used to identify 
the class of the functionality: &quot;Ada.Containers.Bounded_Sets&quot; 
(for a set with a maximum number of elements); &quot;Ada.Containers.Protected_Maps&quot; 
(for a map which can be accessed by multiple tasks at one time); &quot;Ada.Containers.Persistent_Vectors&quot; 
(for a persistent vector which continues to exist between executions 
of a program) and so on.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.n">5.n/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Note that the 
language already includes several requirements that are important to 
the use of containers. These include:</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.o">5.o/2</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">Library packages must be reentrant &ndash; 
multiple tasks can use the packages as long as they operate on separate 
containers. Thus, it is only necessary for a user to protect a container 
if a single container needs to be used by multiple tasks.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.p">5.p/2</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">Language-defined types must stream &quot;properly&quot;. 
That means that the stream attributes can be used to implement persistence 
of containers when necessary, and containers can be passed between partitions 
of a program.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.q">5.q/2</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">Equality of language-defined types must compose 
&ldquo;properly&rdquo;. This means that the version of &quot;=&quot; 
directly used by users is the same one that will be used in generics 
and in predefined equality operators of types with components of the 
containers and/or cursors. This prevents the abstraction from breaking 
unexpectedly.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.q.1">5.q.1/3</a></div>
<div class="SmallBulleted">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0048-1.TXT">AI05-0048-1</A></I>} 
Redispatching is not allowed (unless it is required). That means that 
overriding a container operation will not change the behavior of any 
other predefined container operation. This provides a stable base for 
extensions.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.r">5.r/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">If a container's element type is controlled, 
the point at which the element is finalized will depend on the implementation 
of the container. We do not specify precisely where this will happen 
(it will happen no later than the finalization of the container, of course) 
in order to give implementation's flexibility to cache, block, or split 
the nodes of the container. In particular, Delete does not necessarily 
finalize the element; the implementation may (or may not) hold the space 
for reuse.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.s">5.s/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">This is not likely to be a hardship, as the 
element type has to be nonlimited. Types used to manage scarce resources 
generally need to be limited. Otherwise, the amount of resources needed 
is hard to control, as the language allows a lot of variation in the 
number or order of adjusts/finalizations. For common uses of nonlimited 
controlled types such as managing storage, the types already have to 
manage arbitrary copies.</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.t">5.t/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations">The use of controlled types also brings up the 
possibility of failure of finalization (and thus deallocation) of an 
element. This is a &ldquo;serious bug&rdquo;, as AI95-179 puts it, so 
we don't try to specify what happens in that case. The implementation 
should propagate the exception.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.u">5.u/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Implementation Note:&nbsp;</B>It is expected that 
exceptions propagated from these operations do not damage containers. 
That is, if Storage_Error is propagated because of an allocation failure, 
or Constraint_Error is propagated by the assignment of elements, the 
container can continue to be used without further exceptions. The intent 
is that it should be possible to recover from errors without losing data. 
We don't try to state this formally in most cases, because it is hard 
to define precisely what is and is not allowed behavior.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum"><a name="p5.v">5.v/2</a></div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Implementation Note:&nbsp;</B>When this clause 
says that the behavior of something is unspecified<A NAME="I7335"></A>, 
we really mean that any result of executing Ada code short of erroneous 
execution is allowed. We do not mean that memory not belonging to the 
parameters of the operation can be trashed. When we mean to allow erroneous 
behavior, we specifically say that execution is erroneous. All this means 
if the containers are written in Ada is that checks should not be suppressed 
or removed assuming some behavior of other code, and that the implementation 
should take care to avoid creating internal dangling accesses by assuming 
behavior from generic formals that can't be guaranteed. We don't try 
to say this normatively because it would be fairly complex, and implementers 
are unlikely to increase their support costs by fielding implementations 
that are unstable if given buggy hash functions, et al.&nbsp;</div>
