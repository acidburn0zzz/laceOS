<H2>CHAPTER 1: Introduction and Preface</H2>

<H3><a name="1.1">1.1 Goals</a></H3>

This document,  the Rationale  for the  design of  the Ada programming
language, has evolved over a number of years.
<p>
A first  version appeared  in 1978  as the  Rationale  for  the  Green
programming language,  and this  was revised  in 1979 at the time that
Green was  finally selected as Ada. The purpose of these documents was
to explain  the motivation for the language design, and to justify and
defend its  position against  the other  competitive languages and the
Ironman (later  Steelman) requirements.  No corresponding document was
written in  1980 when  Ada was  proposed as a standard, nor in January
1983 when  Ada finally  became both an ANSI and Military Standard. The
present version  completes and  revises a draft issued in January 1984
and which was the subject of public review.
<p>
The goal  of these  documents has  also evolved. The original goal was
both motivational  and defensive; a major concern was implementability
(in potentially  controversial  areas  such  as  overload  resolution)
especially since  there were no compilers then in existence. This last
concern is  now substantially  reduced since  implementability is well
demonstrated by a number of production quality compilers.
<p>
Equally the  goal is not to document and justify every language design
decision: it  would be difficult to replace the archive containing the
hundreds of  study notes  and thousands  of comments  produced between
1977 and 1983.
<p>
The present  goal is thus now more inspirational: to give the reader a
feel for  the spirit  of the  language, the  motives  behind  the  key
features and  to create  the basis  for  understanding  how  they  fit
together both  globally as  viewed from  the outside  and in detail as
viewed from  the inside;  above all  to impart  an appreciation of the
main architectural  lines of  the language and its overall philosophy.
It is  only by  knowing this  philosophy that a real understanding for
the detail will be obtained.
<p>
It is  now 1986,  and it may well be asked why this ultimate Rationale
has taken  so long  to emerge.  We must  admit that the main reason is
simply that  we have  been deeply  involved over  the past  years in a
number of  activities aimed  at creating  an infrastructure that would
ensure  the  success  of  the  Ada  language,  -  in  particular,  the
development of training material and compilers. The success of Ada has
now relieved that pressure and allowed us to complete the work started
in 1978,  and to  make available  what we  hope will  be an  important
addition to the Ada literature.
