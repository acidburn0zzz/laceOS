<H2>CHAPTER 12: Generic Units</H2>

<H3><a name="12.4">12.4 Rationale for the Formulation of Generic Units</a></H3>

The generic  facility is  expected to  serve for  the construction  of
general-purpose parameterized  packages.  Whereas  such  packages  are
likely to be utilized by large classes of users, it should be realized
that fewer  programmers will  actually be  involved in writing generic
packages. Accordingly,  we have tried to design a facility that can be
almost ignored  by the majority of users. They must indeed know how to
instantiate a  generic package,  and this is fairly easy. On the other
hand, they  need not  be  familiar  with  the  rules  and  precautions
necessary for writing generic units.
<p>
A major  simplification, in  this respect,  is achieved by adopting an
approach based  on a  context-dependent extension  of the  traditional
techniques of  macro-expansion. This  solution has  the  advantage  of
introducing  only  a  minimum  of  additional  features.  It  is  well
implementable within  the state  of  the  art,  and  it  provides  the
flexibility required by the applications.
<p>
This approach  has important  consequences for  the  specification  of
generic formal  parameters. The  other major  simplifying  assumptions
made  in   the  language   concern  the   requirement   for   explicit
instantiation, and  the specification  of formal operations applicable
to formal types. These issues will be discussed separately below.

The requirement  that instantiation be explicit greatly simplifies the
compilation of program units obtained by generic instantiation.
<p>
The  approach   taken   here   clearly   distinguishes   between   the
instantiation of a program unit, obtained from a generic unit, and the
invocation of the resulting program unit - calling a subprogram, using
a package. Thereby it emphasizes the contrast between translation-time
substitution of  generic actual  parameters and execution-time passage
of actual parameters to subprograms. Explicit instantiation provides a
well-defined locus  for  the  point  of  instantiation  and  also  for
reporting any  errors  arising  from  inconsistent  substitution.  The
resultant program  unit  can  be  invoked  subsequently  as  often  as
required, with  the same degree of power and security as for any other
nongeneric program  unit; this  is a  consequence of  the fact  that a
program unit  obtained by  generic instantiation  is indistinguishable
from the  same  program  unit  defined  explicitly  at  the  point  of
instantiation.
<p>
An alternative solution considered was implicit instantiation. For the
purpose of the discussion of the complexity of implicit instantiation,
consider the  following generic  function (which  is actually  just  a
different way  of writing  the power  function  given  in  a  previous
section):
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is private;
  with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM;
function POWER(E :  ELEM;  N :  POSITIVE) return ELEM;

function POWER(E :  ELEM;  N :  POSITIVE) return ELEM is
begin
  if N = 1 then
    return E;
  else
    return E &#42; POWER(E, N - 1);
  end if;
end POWER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If implicit instantiation were provided, then for:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
R :  RATIONAL;
I :  INTEGER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
exponentiation could  be applied without prior explicit instantiation.
Thus:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
POWER(R , 5)
POWER(I , 5)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
would both be legal. The actual type used for ELEM would be implicitly
inferred from  the actual  parameter associated  with E in each call -
that is, RATIONAL for R, INTEGER for I.
<p>
Implicit  instantiation   would   complicate   the   rules   for   the
identification of  overloaded subprograms.  If a version of POWER were
defined directly within the package RATIONAL_NUMBERS itself:
<p>
<PRE>    function POWER(E :  RATIONAL;  N :  INTEGER) return RATIONAL;</PRE>
<p>
then this  explicit definition would hide the generic definition in an
application such  as POWER(R, 5). Thus the generic definition would be
visible for  some types  and hidden  for others. This added complexity
would reflect on compilers, and also on program readability.
<p>
Another problem  would arise  for the  identification of  POWER in the
body of  the generic  unit itself:  would this be a recursive implicit
instantiation or  a recursive call of the same instance? In the simple
example considered,  it could  be easily  interpreted as  a  recursive
call. However, in general, it is not at all clear that the problem can
always be  resolved by  a  static  analysis  of  the  program  (unless
restrictions are adopted). A sufficient condition to guarantee that no
generic operation  will ever  require an  unbounded number of implicit
generic instantiations  during execution  has been  given in  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BJ 78]</a>.
However such checks require a quite complex analysis of the program.
<p>
In conclusion, implicit instantiation is still a research subject. The
only solution  within  the  current  state  of  the  art  is  explicit
instantiation and this is therefore the solution chosen for Ada.
<p>
Explicit instantiation  certainly requires more writing on the part of
the user,  but it  provides better awareness of the instances that are
created and  thus  contributes  to  reliability  and  readability.  In
addition, it  offers distinct advantages in terms of efficiency, since
compilers can easily identify the existing instantiations and, in some
cases, achieve  optimizations such  as sharing  of code  among several
instantiations of the same generic unit.

<H3><BR><a name="12.4.2">12.4.2 Generic Formal Parameters: The Contract Model</a></H3>

As stated earlier, a user instantiating a given generic package should
be able  to ignore  the details  of the  generic body  completely.  In
particular, if  any error is made in instantiating a generic unit, the
error should  be  reported  to  the  user  in  terms  of  the  generic
instantiation itself  - not  in terms  of the internals of the generic
body. This requirement influences the form used for specifying generic
formal parameters.
<p>
Consider by  analogy what is done for subprograms. For a normal - that
is,  nongeneric  -  procedure,  specification  of  parameters  permits
independent checks  of the  procedure body on the one hand, and of the
procedure calls  on the  other hand.  Both must  conform to the formal
parameter  specifications  and  these  legality  checks  can  be  done
independently: the  procedure specification  is  a  sort  of  contract
between the procedure body and the corresponding procedure calls.
<p>
The specification  of generic  formal parameters must achieve the same
degree of independence:
<ol type=a>
<li>For a  given generic  body, it  should be possible to
   check that  its text  is consistent  with  respect  to  the  formal
   parameter specifications.
<p>
<li>For a  given  generic  instantiation,  it  should  be
   possible to  check that  the actual  parameters are consistent with
   respect to the formal parameter specifications.
<p>
<li>The precision  of the formal parameter specifications
   should be  sufficient to  guarantee that  if the checks (a) and (b)
   are successful, then the corresponding instantiations produce legal
   program units.
</ol>

The solution  adopted to  achieve these  goals is  to require that all
operations  of   a  generic  formal  type  be  determinable  from  its
specification:
<ul>
<li>For a  formal type  specified as  limited private,  no operation is
   assumed available  (apart from  certain attributes:  see <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-07-04.html#7.4.2">RM 7.4.2</a>).
   Hence any operation that is applied to an object of the formal type
   within the  generic unit  must be  provided as  an explicit generic
   formal parameter.
<p>
<li>For a  formal type  specified as  private (not  limited), the  same
   holds except  that assignment  and the  predefined  comparison  for
   equality and inequality are available.
<p>
<li>For a  generic formal  type declared  as a type pattern with a box,
   the operations  of the  corresponding kind  of type  are available:
   they are  implicitly declared.  For  example,  the  floating  point
   operators are  available for  any generic  formal type  defined  by
   "digits &lt;&gt;".  Any other  operation must be provided explicitly by a
   generic formal parameter.
</ul>

When the  body of  a generic unit is being checked, the generic formal
part thus  provides the information required for the identification of
all operations.  When a  given instantiation  is  being  checked,  the
demands of  the generic  formal part  must be met and incorrect actual
parameters  can  be  reported.  These  two  checks  can  be  performed
independently. Furthermore, if errors exist in an instantiation, error
messages can  be formulated in terms of the generic formal part, which
is necessarily  known, rather  than in  terms of  the details  of  the
generic body, which might be separately compiled and hidden.
<p>
Consider for  example the  generic formal  part given  for the generic
function POWER:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is private;
  with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM;
function POWER(E :  ELEM;  N :  POSITIVE) return ELEM;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The operation "&#42;" is explicitly provided as a generic parameter, along
with the  type ELEM  itself. The  parameter E  and the  result of  the
function POWER  are both  specified as  being  of  this  formal  type.
Thereafter the  identification of the "&#42;" appearing within the generic
body:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function POWER(E :  ELEM;  N :  POSITIVE) return ELEM is
begin
  if N = 1 then
    return E;
  else
    return E &#42; POWER(E, N - 1);
  end if;
end POWER;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
within the  expression   E &#42;  POWER(E, N-1)  can be done as usual - it
refers to  the "&#42;"  declared in the generic formal part. Similarly the
recursive call  of POWER  can be  correctly identified (since implicit
instantiation  is   not  allowed).  Hence  the  generic  body  can  be
completely checked.
<p>
Similarly a generic instantiation such as
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(ELEM =&gt;  MATRIX, "&#42;" =&gt; MULT);</PRE>
<p>
can be  fully checked: Consider the function specification obtained by
substituting in  the generic  formal function  the name  MULT for  the
designator "&#42;", and the actual type MATRIX for the formal type ELEM:
<p>
<PRE>    function MULT(LEFT, RIGHT :  MATRIX) return MATRIX;</PRE>
<p>
Then the  instantiation is correct if there is - in the context of the
instantiation - a function MULT with this parameter and result profile
- the  only allowed  difference being  for the names of the parameters
(LEFT and RIGHT). Conversely, consider:
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(ELEM =&gt;  RATIONAL,  "&#42;" =&gt;  "not");     -- ILLEGAL!</PRE>
<p>
This generic instantiation can be reported as incorrect since there is
no operation not corresponding to the specification
<p>
<PRE>    function "not" (LEFT, RIGHT :  RATIONAL) return RATIONAL;     -- ILLEGAL!</PRE>
<p>
An alternative considered in this design was the implicit inference of
operations  of   a  formal   type.  The  reasons  for  rejecting  this
alternative are  similar to those leading to the rejection of implicit
instantiation. With  implicit inference  of operations,  the  previous
example could be rewritten as:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is private;
function POWER(E :  ELEM;  N :  POSITIVE) return ELEM;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
and we would be left with the problem of identifying the "&#42;" operation
used in  the body.  For a  given  instantiation,  say  with  the  type
RATIONAL, should the "&#42;" operation be identified as a global operation
in the  context of  the generic  declaration or  in the context of the
generic instantiation?  The two  alternatives might  lead to different
results.
<p>
Note also that a statement such as
<p>
<PRE>    return E &#42; E &#42; E;</PRE>
<p>
would be ambiguous in the presence of several overloadings of "&#42;"; for
example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "&#42;" (X, Y :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;        --  (1)
function "&#42;" (X, Y :  RATIONAL)  return INTEGER;         --  (2)
function "&#42;" (X, :  INTEGER;  Y :  RATIONAL)  return RATIONAL;   -- (3)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
One  possible  interpretation  would  identify  both  operations  with
definition (1);  another interpretation  would identify  the first "&#42;"
with (2) and the second with (3).
<p>
In general,  the specifications  of the identified operations could be
quite different  from instantiation  to instantiation depending on the
operations visible  in the  context of the instantiation. None of this
can happen with an explicit specification of the formal operation "&#42;".
<p>
To  summarize,   implicit  inference   of  operations,  based  on  the
instantiation, would  introduce awkward  context-dependence and  would
require  complete   rechecking  of   the   generic   body   for   each
instantiation.   This   last   consequence   would   be   particularly
unfortunate, since  generic bodies  could not  be checked  (and proved
correct) independently of the context. It would defeat the goal stated
initially, since  some error messages would have to be stated in terms
of what is done within the generic body.
<p>
Note that  none of  the problems  of implicit  inference based  on the
instantiation  arise   with  the   implicit  specification  of  formal
operations that  exists for  type patterns  with boxes.  Consider  for
example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is digits &lt;&gt;;
function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM;

function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM is
begin
  return X &#42; X;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Here the  declaration of  the formal  type has the effect of providing
implicit declarations  for the operators of floating point types. Thus
we have an implicitly declared formal function
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM;</PRE>
<p>
so that  identification of  the "&#42;"  used in  the generic body is done
solely in terms of the generic specification.
<p>
The Ada  solution permits independent checking of generic units and of
generic  instantiations.   Hence  it  largely  fulfills  our  goal  of
permitting the  user to  ignore the  internal details  of the  generic
units instantiated in his programs.
<p>
One limitation  of the  contract model concerns the ability to declare
unconstrained objects.  Consider a  variant of  the formulation of the
generic procedure EXCHANGE:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ITEM is private;
procedure EXCHANGE(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out ITEM);

procedure EXCHANGE(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out ITEM) is
  TEMPORARY :  ITEM;
begin
  TEMPORARY :=  LEFT;
  LEFT :=  RIGHT;
  RIGHT :=  TEMPORARY;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Then an instantiation with an unconstrained array type such as
<p>
<PRE>    procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  STRING);</PRE>
<p>
will not work since a declaration of an unconstrained variable of type
STRING (here  TEMPORARY) would  not be allowed. The same problem would
arise if  the actual  type were a type with discriminants that must be
constrained. Note  on the  other hand  that the problem does not exist
for constants - as in the original formulation:
<p>
<PRE>    OLD_LEFT :  constant ITEM  :=  LEFT;</PRE>
<p>
This limitation  means that some instantiations may be rejected on the
grounds that  the body  requires the  ability to declare unconstrained
objects of  the formal type. We have considered this consequence to be
preferable to an increase in the complexity of the syntax.
<p>
Another limitation  concerns representation clauses. It is illustrated
by the following example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type T is private;
package OCTETS is
  type R is
    record
      A :  T;
    end record;
  for R'SIZE use 8;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
since any  instantiation with  a type  such that T'SIZE &gt; 8 will fail.
Again, such  cases are considered sufficiently abnormal not to warrant
any special language rule.
<p>
To conclude this section on formal types let us note that Ada provides
formal types for all classes of type except record and task types. The
major reason for this is that it is not clear that reasonable criteria
for matching  exist for  these type  classes -  criteria that would be
consistent with  the degree  of type checking performed elsewhere, yet
at the  same time  have a  good probability  of being  usable for many
actual record types and task types.

<H3><BR><a name="12.4.3">12.4.3 Default Generic Parameters</a></H3>

As stated  before, all  operations applicable to a formal type must be
specified explicitly  in the  generic formal  part.  Nevertheless,  in
order to keep generic instantiations as simple as possible, a facility
for specifying default values for generic parameters is offered, as it
is for normal subprograms.
<p>
In many  cases, such defaults will actually be expressed by boxes. For
example, the  generic formal part of the generic function POWER can be
rewritten as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is private;
  with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM is &lt;&gt;;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This parallels  exactly the  treatment of  in parameters  with default
values for  subprograms. The  default parameter  is optional,  and  an
instantiation such as
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(RATIONAL);</PRE>
<p>
is taken as equivalent to the generic instantiation
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(ELEM =&gt;  RATIONAL,  "&#42;" =&gt;  "&#42;");</PRE>
<p>
where the actual operation "&#42;" should have the specification
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (name_1, name_2 :  RATIONAL) return RATIONAL;</PRE>
<p>
and the  instantiation is  legal if  there is such a "&#42;" operation for
the type  RATIONAL, whatever  may be the parameter names. For the same
reason
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(BOOLEAN);</PRE>
<p>
would be an error, since no such operation exists for the type BOOLEAN
(assuming no  explicit definition).  Again, the  generic body  and the
generic instantiations  can be checked independently. Furthermore, the
default can always be overridden by providing an explicit parameter as
in
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;&#42;" is new POWER(VECTOR, MULT);</PRE>
<p>
To summarize,  the necessity  to be  able  to  check  a  generic  body
independently  of   its  generic  instantiations  (an  important  user
requirement) forces  all operations  applicable to a formal type to be
specified, explicitly  or implicitly, by the generic formal part. This
could increase  the number of generic parameters that must be supplied
and could  hence lead  to a  heavy syntax  of generic  instantiations.
However,  defaults   can  be  specified  for  these  operations,  thus
restoring much of the simplicity while losing none of the security.
<p>
In most  applications it  should be  possible to  have only  types  as
mandatory parameters  and to provide defaults for all operations. This
is consistent with the goal stated in the introduction, that writing a
generic unit  may well  require some  care, but  using it  ought to be
extremely simple.
