<H2>CHAPTER 14: Exception Handling</H2>

<H3><a name="14.5">14.5 Technical Issues</a></H3>

The discussion  of exception handling in <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Go 75]</a> classifies exceptions
into three categories:
<ol type=a>
<li>Escape exceptions  which require  termination of  the
   operation that raised the exception
<p>
<li>Notify exceptions,  which forbid  termination of  the
   operation that  raised the  exception and  require  its  resumption
   after completion of the actions of the handler
<p>
<li>Signal exceptions,  which leave  the  choice  between
   termination and resumption to the handler
</ol>

Exceptions in  Ada are  of the  escape category.  They serve  only for
error situations  and as  terminating conditions, which simplifies the
language: notify  and signal  exceptions are not provided, since these
forms of  exception violate  program modularity  and make optimization
difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
The technical  problems of  the interactions  between  exceptions  and
parallelism have  been mentioned in the previous section. The key idea
was to  provide a  simple rule for cases where simultaneous exceptions
occur in  a given  task. For the TASKING_ERROR exception, multiplicity
can only  occur in  the case of nested accept statements, and then the
outer exception prevails.
<p>
The remainder  of this  discussion will  concentrate on  the following
issues:
<ul>
<li>Exceptions raised during the elaboration of declarations
<p>
<li>Propagation of exceptions beyond their scope
<p>
<li>Suppression of exceptions
<p>
<li>Implementation of exception handling
<p>
<li>The case against asynchronous exceptions
<p>
<li>Proving programs with exceptions
</ul>

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.1">14.5.1 Exceptions Raised During the Elaboration of Declarations</a></H3>

The elaboration  of declarations  may involve  the evaluation  of some
expressions, and  in consequence, exceptions may be raised during this
elaboration. Consider for example the procedure
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure A(N :  INTEGER) is
  C :  constant INTEGER  :=  N &#42; N;
  D :  INTEGER  :=  C;
  T :  array (1 .. C) of INTEGER;
begin
  -- statements of A
exception
  -- handlers of A
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If an  exception occurs  during the elaboration of the constant C, the
procedure will be in a state where D is not initialized, and the space
for the  array T is not yet allocated. Consequently, a handler may not
be able  to do much; any reference to D or T will be erroneous and may
cause a  further exception.  For these  reasons an exception raised by
the elaboration  of a  declaration is  never handled  locally;  it  is
propagated to  the place where the elaboration of the declarations was
initiated: for  example, this  place may  be just  after the call of a
subprogram in  whose body  the declarations  are written, or it may be
just after a block in whose declarative part the declarations appear.

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.2">14.5.2 Propagation of an Exception Beyond its Scope</a></H3>

Since an  exception can be propagated, it can be propagated beyond its
scope. It  is even  possible for an exception to be propagated outside
its scope and then back again within its scope. Thus, in the following
example, if  B calls  OUTSIDE and OUTSIDE calls A, the exception ERROR
raised within A will be propagated to OUTSIDE and again to B:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package D is
  procedure A;
  procedure B;
end;

procedure OUTSIDE is
begin
  ...
  D.A;
  ...
end;

package body D is
  ERROR :  exception;
  procedure A is
  begin
    ... raise ERROR; ...
  end;

  procedure B is
  begin
    ...
    OUTSIDE;
    ...
  exception
    when ERROR =&gt;
      -- ERROR may be propagated by OUTSIDE calling A
  end;
end D;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
An exception  propagated beyond its scope can only be handled there by
a handler  for others. It can be further propagated or raised again by
the abbreviated form of the raise statement (raise;).
<p>
This rule provides a simple and consistent interpretation of the above
example and  it avoids the complexity and run-time costs that would be
incurred if  exceptions propagated  beyond their  scope were converted
into a  unique undefined  exception. This  design also considered, and
rejected, the  possibility of  associating the  names of  the possibly
propagated exceptions with each procedure declaration. The main reason
for rejecting  this possibility  is the  fact that  this would require
extra run-time  code for  filtering the propagation of exceptions. For
example, if a procedure were declared as
<p>
<PRE>    procedure P(X :  INTEGER) PROPAGATES A, B, C;      -- not in Ada</PRE>
<p>
its body  would have to be compiled as the equivalent of the following
procedure:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure P(X :  INTEGER) is
  ...
begin
  ...
exception
  when A | B | C =&gt;  raise;
  when others =&gt;  raise anonymous_exception;
end P;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
We  considered   the  resulting  code  expansion  to  be  prohibitive,
especially in the case of small functions and procedures.
<p>
With the  solution adopted  in Ada,  the user  can always  put similar
information in  comment form.  The choice  others covers  all possible
anonymous exceptions, not just one.
<p>
The philosophy  behind the  Ada model  is that  an exception is not an
error situation;  it is  only a  name that  is declared  for an  error
situation. Like  any other declaration, an exception declaration has a
scope. The  error situation, on the other hand has no such limits, and
can always be referred to as part of the others exception choice.
<p>
The internal  codes associated  with exceptions must all be distinct -
as are  the codes of the different literals of an enumeration type. In
general, this  assignment of  codes to exceptions must be performed at
linkage editing time.

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.3">14.5.3 Suppression of Checks</a></H3>

A given program unit, and in particular a procedure, may be robust, in
that it  will perform  some computation,  and produce some result, for
any value of its input parameters. On the other hand, its validity may
only be  guaranteed  for  certain  values  of  these  parameters.  The
exception mechanism  is a  useful tool to achieve robustness, but this
may be  gained at  some cost  in efficiency,  since detection  of some
error situations may be expensive unless aided by special hardware.
<p>
In some  cases where  robustness can  be attained  by means other than
run-time checks,  the programmer  may not  wish to  incur the  cost of
checking for certain error situations. The pragma
<p>
<PRE>    pragma SUPPRESS(check_name);</PRE>
<p>
indicates that  the check  named in  the pragma need not be performed.
(Should a  violation of the corresponding condition occur, behavior of
the program would be unpredictable.)
<p>
In the  presence of  such pragmas, the compiler may suppress the named
checks, and will do so if this results in an optimization.
<p>
However, in the case of exceptions whose detection is aided by special
hardware, inhibiting  the corresponding  hardware  mechanisms  may  be
costlier than  actually performing the checks. Hence the pragma is not
imperative - it does not mean that the checks are not done.
<p>
An alternative  view of  the SUPPRESS  pragma would  regard  it  as  a
directive indicating  imperatively that no check is to be performed to
detect the  exception. This  approach would  amount to  a decision  to
continue execution  of the program in spite of any error situation. It
would give  an appearance  of robustness  which might  be exploited in
cases where  the programmer  knows that  the error situation will have
some effects  that can be detected at a later time, but it is contrary
to the general philosophy of the language.
<p>
In addition, the need to provide a semantics that reconciles software-
and hardware-detected  exceptions would  have a negative effect on the
efficiency of  programs. If  the pragma  were imperative,  then  on  a
machine with  hardware-detected exceptions  it would  be necessary  to
inhibit the  hardware checks  for a  scope in  which  a  corresponding
pragma SUPPRESS  is given. Thereafter, it would be necessary to enable
the hardware  detection again,  prior to  each call  to a unit outside
that scope,  and again to inhibit the detection following a subsequent
return from the call.

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.4">14.5.4 Implementation of Exception Handling</a></H3>

One important design consideration for the exception handling facility
is that  exceptions should  add to  execution time  only if  they  are
raised.
<p>
Several techniques may be used to reach that goal, and they may differ
from one  implementation to  another. The  essential idea  is that the
run-time processing  costs should  be concentrated on the treatment of
the raise statement. Consequently, processing of a raise statement may
be relatively  slow. In  contrast, the costs associated with exception
declarations and  exception handlers are only in terms of space and in
terms of  compilation time  - they  have no influence on the execution
time.
<p>
As a feasibility proof, we outline a possible implementation technique
in which  no run-time  costs whatsoever  are incurred  for  exceptions
unless they  are  raised.  This  technique  has  been  used  for  some
debugging systems  and it bears some resemblance to the technique used
in Mesa <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[GMS 77]</a>. The basic principles are as follows:
<ol type=a>
<li>When  an  exception  occurs,  the  specific  run-time
   system that  treats exceptions must be able to locate the addresses
   of  the   currently  active  procedure  calls.  This  condition  is
   satisfied if  (as is  usually the case) return addresses are stored
   in procedure activations.
<p>
<li>Knowing the  code address  of a procedure, it must be
   possible  to   locate  the  code  address  of  the  first  handler.
   Similarly, given  a handler,  it must  be possible to find the next
   handler. This  condition can  be satisfied by chaining the handlers
   and by  storing the  address of  the first  handler just before the
   code of the procedure.
<p>
<li>Each handler  must start  with the  indication of the
   exception code (or codes) that it services. Some convention must be
   used for the handler for others, which must appear last.
<p>
<li>When effecting the association of an exception with a
   handler, the run-time system locates the procedure address and from
   there the  chain of  handlers. It  may then  inspect the  exception
   codes to find the appropriate handler, if any.
</ol>

We reiterate  that this  solution should  only  be  considered  as  an
existence proof  that exceptions  may be implemented at no cost unless
raised. Other  techniques may  be  more  suitable,  depending  on  the
machine architecture.

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.5">14.5.5 The Case Against Asynchronous Exceptions</a></H3>

The normal  means of  communicating with  a task  is via  entry calls.
Hence most  situations in  which the  termination of  a task  must  be
decided by  another task  should be  programmed by  calling a  special
entry, say STOP, of the task to be terminated (or by using a terminate
alternative).  The   clear  advantage   of  such  a  solution  is  the
possibility thus  offered of  including accept statements for the STOP
entry at  those places where the termination can be done in an orderly
fashion.
<p>
The ability  for one  task to  raise an exception in another task must
however be  viewed as a possibility that has - potentially - extremely
severe  consequences.   In  no   way  should  such  externally  raised
exceptions be  considered  as  being  normal  terminating  conditions.
Interfering asynchronously  with the  execution of a task may catch it
in a  state where  it is not prepared to respond to such intervention.
There is  then always  a risk  of leaving  the  task  in  a  state  of
confusion,  and   also  of   contaminating  other   tasks  that   were
communicating with it.

<H3><BR><a name="14.5.6">14.5.6 Proving Programs with Exceptions</a></H3>

The problems  of exception  handling facilities  such as  the <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">PL/I</a> on
conditions, which  permit resumption  after the  exception, are  well-
known.  For   instance,  assuming   integer  working,   consider   the
consecutive statements:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X :=  P + Q;
Y :=  X - Q;
ASSERT (Y = P);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Unless overflow occurs in the evaluation of P + Q, the final assertion
should be  satisfied. This  however would not be true if a handler for
overflow were  able to  provide a  different value for X and return to
the same statement list.
<p>
This simple  example shows  the near impossibility of proving programs
with unrestricted  signal and notify exceptions. For the same reasons,
such programs are extremely difficult to optimize.
<p>
In contrast, for the proposal chosen in Ada, simple proof rules may be
given, as  has been  shown by  Bron <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BFH  76]</a> and  Fokkinga  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Fo  77]</a>.
Additional examples  may be  found in  the reference <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[DH 76]</a>. The main
idea is a consequence of the definition of the role of a handler.
<p>
As mentioned  above, when  an exception  occurs in  a  procedure,  the
execution of  the handler  completes the  execution of  the  procedure
considered. Consequently the effect of a procedure is achieved either:
<ol type=a>
<li>by its body if no exception occurs
<p>
or, if the exception E occurs:
<p>
<li>by the  part of  its body  up to  the point where the
   exception E occurs, and then by the handler for E.
</ol>

Two simple cases have been shown in the programming examples:
<ol>
<li>In the  SAFE_INSERT example of <a href="ratl-14-03.html#14.3.4">section 14.3.4</a> we have
   shown a  case where  these two  rules reduce to a simpler form. The
   effect of SAFE_INSERT is achieved either:
<p>
<ol type=a>
    <li>by its body if no exception occurs, or
<p>
    <li>by the handler for TABLE_FULL if TABLE_FULL occurs.
</ol>
<p>
<li>In the  file example  of <a href="ratl-14-03.html#14.3.3">section  14.3.3</a>,  where  the
   exception END_ERROR  is used as a terminating condition, the effect
   of the  procedure TRANSFER  is achieved  by the  succession of  the
   effects of
<p>
<ol type=a>
    <li>its body
<p>
    <li>the body of the handler for END_ERROR.
</ol>
</ol>

This shows  that, with adequate programming conventions, the effect of
a procedure that contains an exception handler can be characterized in
a simple way. This simplifies correctness proofs.
