<H3><a name="1.2">1.2     To The New Ada Programmer</a></H3>

At first sight, Ada offers a bewildering variety of features. It is a powerful 
tool intended to solve difficult problems, and almost every feature has a 
legitimate application in some context. This makes it especially important to 
use Ada's features in a disciplined and organized way. The guidelines in this 
book forbid the use of few Ada features. Rather, they show how the features 
can be systematically deployed to write clear, high-quality programs. 
Following the guidelines will make learning Ada easier and help you to master 
its apparent complexity. From the beginning, you can write programs that 
exploit the best features of the language in the way that the designers 
intended.
<P>
Programmers experienced in using another programming language are often 
tempted to use Ada as if it were their familiar language but with irritating 
syntactic differences. This pitfall should be avoided at all costs; it can 
lead to convoluted code that subverts exactly those aspects of Ada that make 
it so suitable for building high-quality systems. You must learn to &quot;think 
Ada&quot;; following the guidelines in this book and reading the examples of their use will help you to do this as quickly and painlessly as possible.
<P>
To some degree, novice programmers learning Ada have an advantage. Following 
the guidelines from the beginning helps in developing a clear programming 
style that effectively exploits the language. If you are in this category, it 
is recommended that you adopt the guidelines for those exercises you perform 
as part of learning Ada. Initially, developing sound programming habits by 
concentrating on the guidelines themselves, and their supporting examples, is 
more important than understanding the rationale for each guideline. Note that 
each chapter ends with a summary of the guidelines it contains.
<P>
The rationale for many of the guidelines help experienced programmers  
understand and accept the suggestions presented in the guideline. Some of the  
guidelines themselves are also written for the experienced programmer who must  
make engineering tradeoffs. This is especially true in the areas of  
portability, reusability, and performance. These more difficult guidelines and  
rationale will make you aware of the issues affecting each programming  
decision. You can then use that awareness to recognize the engineering  
tradeoffs that you will eventually be asked to make when you are the  
experienced Ada programmer.
