<H2>CHAPTER 4: Types</H2>

<H3><a name="4.2">4.2 The Concept of Type</a></H3>

Ada provides  a capability to define new types. The language construct
used to  declare a  new type is called a type declaration. Examples of
type declarations appear below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type INT is range -2&#42;&#42;24 .. 2&#42;&#42;24;                     -- integer type
type SCALE is (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH);                     -- enumeration type
type MASS is digits 8 range 0.0 .. 1.0E9;              -- floating point type
type VOLT is delta 0.01 range 0.0 .. 1_000.0;          -- fixed point type
type LINE is array (1 .. 128) of CHARACTER;            -- array type
type PAIR is record X, Y :  INTEGER; end record;       -- record type
type MY_INT is new INTEGER;                            -- derived type
type TEXT is access STRING;                            -- access type
type FILE is limited private;                          -- private type
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
As stated  in the  <a href="ratl-04-01.html#4.1">introduction</a>, a  type is  characterized by a set of
values and  a set  of  operations.  To  illustrate  this  we  can  use
enumeration types:  in many  ways they  are the simplest form of type,
yet they  are  sufficient  to  discuss  the  most  important  aspects.
Consider for example:
<p>
<PRE>    type DAY is (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN);
</PRE><p>
Each of  the identifiers  thus enumerated  is  called  an  enumeration
literal and  can be  viewed as  a (parameterless) function that always
delivers the  same value.  Hence we  have a  distinct value  for  each
enumeration literal, and so we have seven values for the type DAY.
<p>
Consider now  the set  of operations  that is - implictly - defined by
this type declaration. This set includes
<UL>
<li> Equality and inequality:&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE> =   /=</CODE>
<p>
<li> Ordering relations:&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE> &lt;   &lt;=   &gt;   &gt;=</CODE>
<p>
<li> The assignment basic operation:&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>:=</CODE>
<p>
<li> Other basic  operations called attributes. These all start with the
   type name  followed by  an apostrophe  ('). They include attributes
   such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
DAY'FIRST      -- yields MON
DAY'LAST       -- yields SUN
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
   and other  attributes that  are functions  with a single parameter;
   the latter include
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
DAY'SUCC       --  for example,  DAY'SUCC(MON)    =  TUE
DAY'PRED       --  for example,  DAY'PRED(TUE)    =  MON
DAY'POS        --  for example,  DAY'POS(MON)     =  0
DAY'VAL        --  for example,  DAY'VAL(0)       =  MON
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<li> Finally, the  basic operations involved in membership tests (in and
   not in), and qualification by the type DAY itself.
</ul>

Thus the  declaration of the type DAY has implicitly defined the above
set of  values and  operations, and  thereby what we are allowed to do
with objects and values of type DAY. To appreciate the contribution of
this concept to program reliability consider the interactions of three
important rules in typed languages such as <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a> and Ada:
<ol type=a>
<li> All  objects   (variables  and   constants)  must  be
   declared.
<p>
<li> The declaration of an object must specify its type.
<p>
<li> Any operation on an object must preserve its type.
</ol>

It results  from the  above rules  that  the  type  of  an  object  is
invariant during program execution: it is the type given in the object
declaration. All  properties characterized  by the  type are therefore
static and  must be  checked at  compilation time by Ada compilers. To
illustrate this point consider the additional declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DIRECTION is (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST);
GOAL   :  DIRECTION;
TODAY  :  DAY;
START  :  DAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
With these  declarations,  an  Ada  compiler  will  accept  assignment
statements such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TODAY  :=  MON;
GOAL   :=  WEST;
START  :=  TODAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Consider for example the first one: TODAY is a variable declared to be
of type  DAY; there  is an  assignment operation (:=) defined for this
type; assignment  to a variable is allowed, but it requires a value of
the same type: and there is actually a literal MON that yields a value
of type  DAY. Using  similar simple rules, an Ada compiler must reject
each of the following illegal assignment statements:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TODAY :=  WEST;           -- Illegal: WEST is not a DAY value
TODAY :=  5;              -- Illegal: 5 is not a DAY value
TODAY :=  TODAY + START;  -- Illegal: "+" is not defined for DAYS
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In the  last case,  TODAY and  START are  both of  type  DAY  but  the
operation "+"  is not  defined for this type and this knowledge allows
rejection of the statement.
<p>
This example  demonstrates that  the contribution of enumeration types
to the  quality of  programs goes far beyond increased readability. We
could actually achieve a comparable degree of readability in languages
such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 68</a>,  which do not provide enumeration types (or even in
<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a>, using  data or  parameter statements).  The set  of Algol  68 declarations could be as follows
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
&oslash; days of the week: &oslash;
int MON=1, TUE=2, WED=3, THU=4, FRI=5, SAT=6, SUN=7;
&oslash; directions: &oslash;
int NORTH=1, EAST=2, SOUTH=3, WEST=4;
int GOAL, TODAY, START;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
thereby allowing  the same degree of readability as Ada for statements
such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TODAY  :=  MON;
GOAL   :=  WEST;
START  :=  TODAY;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The real  difference is  one of  reliability. The following statements
would all  be accepted by an Algol 68 compiler, whereas they would all
be rejected by an Ada compiler in the Ada formulation:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TODAY  :=  WEST;
TODAY  :=  8;
TODAY  :=  TODAY + START;
START  :=  2&#42;GOAL - NORTH + SUN&#42;WEST;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
By declaring  DAY as  an enumeration type we expressed the intent that
there be  seven distinct  values with  well-defined  operations.  This
intent was  expressed in a form that permits a compiler to verify that
further  uses  of  days  are  consistent.  Furthermore,  in  declaring
DIRECTION  to  be  a  different  type  (instead  of  having  a  single
enumeration type with eleven values), we have conveyed our intent that
days and directions should not be mixed; and again, we have done so in
a form  that  allows  verification  at  compilation  time  by  an  Ada
compiler.
<p>
In all cases to be examined in later sections, we will find that types
allow the  explicit formulation  of certain  logical  requirements  of
programs. Explicit formulation allows these logical requirements to be
verified  by   a  mechanical   tool  -  the  Ada  compiler  -  thereby
contributing to program reliability.
