<H1>Foreword to this version of the Ada Reference Manual</H1>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.1/1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Standard for the programming 
language Ada is ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E).</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.2/1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ada Working Group ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 9 
is tasked by ISO with the work item to interpret and maintain the International 
Standard and to produce Technical Corrigenda, as appropriate. The technical 
work on the International Standard is performed by the Ada Rapporteur 
Group (ARG) of WG 9. In September 2000, WG 9 approved and forwarded Technical 
Corrigendum 1 to SC 22 for ISO approval, which was granted in February 
2001. Technical Corrigendum 1 was published in June 2001.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.3/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2002, WG 9 approved a schedule and guidelines 
for the preparation of an Amendment to the International Standard. WG 
9 approved the scope of the Amendment in June 2004. In April 2006, WG 
9 approved and forwarded the Amendment to SC 22 for approval, which was 
granted in August 2006. Final ISO/IEC approval is expected by early 2007.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.4/1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Corrigendum lists the individual 
changes that need to be made to the text of the International Standard 
to correct errors, omissions or inconsistencies. The corrections specified 
in Technical Corrigendum 1 are part of the International Standard ISO/IEC 
8652:1995(E).</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.5/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Amendment 1 lists the individual changes 
that need to be made to the text of the International Standard to add 
new features as well as correct errors.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.6/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;When ISO published Technical Corrigendum 1, it 
did not also publish a document that merges the changes from the Technical 
Corrigendum into the text of the International Standard. It is not known 
whether ISO will publish a document that merges the changes from Technical 
Corrigendum and Amendment 1 into the text of the International Standard. 
However, ISO rules require that the project editor for the International 
Standard be able to produce such a document on demand.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.7/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;This version of the Ada Reference Manual is what 
the project editor would provide to ISO in response to such a request. 
It incorporates the changes specified in the Technical Corrigendum and 
Amendment into the text of ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E). It should be understood 
that the publication of any ISO document involves changes in general 
format, boilerplate, headers, etc., as well as a review by professional 
editors that may introduce editorial changes to the text. This version 
of the Ada Reference Manual is therefore neither an official ISO document, 
nor a version guaranteed to be identical to an official ISO document, 
should ISO decide to reprint the International Standard incorporating 
an approved Technical Corrigendum and Amendment. It is nevertheless a 
best effort to be as close as possible to the technical content of such 
an updated document. In the case of a conflict between this document 
and Amendment 1 as approved by ISO (or between this document and Technical 
Corrigendum 1 in the case of paragraphs not changed by Amendment 1; or 
between this document and the original 8652:1995 in the case of paragraphs 
not changed by either Amendment 1 or Technical Corrigendum 1), the other 
documents contain the official text of the International Standard ISO/IEC 
8652:1995(E) and its Amendment.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">0.8/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is very inconvenient to have the Reference 
Manual for Ada specified in three documents, this consolidated version 
of the Ada Reference Manual is made available to the public.</DIV>
