<h1>
Preface
</h1>

<p>
Modern society is becoming very dependent upon software.
Our transport systems, financial systems, medical systems
and defense systems all depend to a very large degree upon
software.  As a consequence the safety of many human lives
and much property now depends upon the reliable functioning
of software.  Moreover, the fall in the cost of hardware has
now made possible the development of large software systems.
</p>
<p>
Ada is a programming language of special value in the
development of large programs which must work reliably.
This applies to most defense applications (from which
background Ada evolved) and extends to many application
domains.  Indeed over half the Ada programs now being
developed are for non-defense applications.
</p>
<p>
   This document describes the rationale for Ada 95, the
revised International Standard.  Ada 95 increases the
flexibility of Ada thus making it applicable to wider
domains but retains the inherent reliability for which Ada
has become noted.  Important aspects of Ada 95 include
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Object Oriented Programming.  Ada 95 includes full OOP
     facilities giving the flexibility of programming by
     extension which enables programs to be extended and
     maintained at lower cost.
<li>
    Hierarchical Libraries.  The library mechanism now
     takes a hierarchical form which is valuable for the
     control and decomposition of large programs.
<li>
    Protected Objects.  The tasking features of Ada are
     enhanced to incorporate a very efficient mechanism for
     multitask synchronized access to shared data.  This is
     of special value for hard realtime systems.
</ul>
<p>
   These enhancements to Ada make Ada 95 an outstanding
language.  It adds the flexibility of languages such as C++
to the reliable Software Engineering framework provided and
proven by Ada 83 over the past ten years.
</p>
<p>
   Ada 95 is a natural evolution of Ada 83.  The
enhancements have been made without disturbing the existing
investment in Ada 83 programs and programmers.  Upward
compatibility has been a prime goal and has been achieved
within the constraints imposed by other requirements.
</p>
<p>
   This document is in several parts.  The first part is an
Introduction to Ada 95; it presents a general discussion of
the scope and objectives of Ada 95 and its major technical
features.  The second part contains a more detailed chapter
by chapter account of the Core language.  The third part
covers the various Annexes which address the predefined
environment and the needs of specialized application areas.
Finally there are three appendices; Appendix X addresses the
issue of upward compatibility with Ada 83 and shows that for
normal programs the goal of compatibility has been achieved;
Appendix Y summarizes the few changes since the two public
drafts of the standard; Appendix Z summarizes the
requirements and concludes that they have been met.  This
document will be of special value to program managers, team
leaders and all software professionals with concern for the
organized development of software.
</p>
<p>
   Ada 95 deserves the attention of all members of the
computing profession.  It is a coherent and reliable
foundation vehicle for developing the major applications of
the next decade.
