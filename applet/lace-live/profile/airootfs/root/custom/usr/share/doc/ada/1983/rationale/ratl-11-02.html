<H2>CHAPTER 11: General Program Structure - Visibility and Overloading</H2>

<H3><a name="11.2">11.2 Program Structure</a></H3>

The overall  structure of  an Ada program text (a compilation unit) is
similar to  that of an <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 60</a> or <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a> text: it appears as a nested
structure of  program units  - subprograms,  packages, task units, and
generic units - and block statements.
<p>
Nesting is  achieved through declarative parts: A declarative part may
contain bodies of program units, and each of these may in turn contain
a declarative  part; furthermore, a sequence of statements may contain
a block statement that contains a declarative part.
<p>
A key  question in  the definition of program structure is that of the
purpose of  nesting. Clearly,  nesting has  been used  in Algol 60 and
Pascal in  relation to  visibility. In  these languages, two units are
written in  the context  of the  same declarative  part if they are to
share the visibility of some common outer entities.
<p>
Is this,  however, the  only purpose of nesting? If it were, a logical
conclusion would  be the  systematic unnesting  of units  that do  not
share any common visibility.
<p>
We consider  this view  to be  too extreme. Units that do not have any
visibility dependence  may nevertheless  be maintained  together in  a
nested text structure for the benefit of the logical exposition of the
program. There  is an  analogy with an encyclopedia, whose material is
organized  into   nested  subjects:   It  is  the  knowledge  of  this
organization that enables the easy retrieval of a given subject.
<p>
Systematic unnesting  of units that do not share any common visibility
would produce  a sequence  of small  units -  not unlike a sequence of
<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a> subprograms.  Finding a  given unit  in  such  a  sequence  is
difficult unless  aided by  a directory  or by some convention such as
alphabetical ordering. Reading the program may also be difficult since
the structure  of the  text does  not reflect the logical organization
and the logical connections.
<p>
For these  reasons, the ability to nest units has been retained in Ada
along with  the ability  to control  visibility that  is  afforded  by
packages and  use clauses. Thus an Ada program appears as a collection
of nested  declarative regions. A given declarative region may include
the declarations  of inner  program units,  in which case it will also
include the  bodies of these program units. Each of these bodies again
defines a  declarative region  which may  in turn  declare other inner
program units.
<p>
In general it is possible to provide the definition of program units -
especially packages - in two textually distinct parts:
<ol>
<li>the  specification,   which   defines   the   logical
   interface (between definition and use) of the program unit
<p>
<li>the body, which describes a particular realization of
   the specification.
</ol>

This possibility  has far reaching implications, in that it provides a
single basis  for  achieving  several  different  objectives,  notably
textual clarity, abstraction, and separate compilation.
<p>
We first  illustrate this ability in the case of a procedure. Consider
for instance the procedure declaration:
<p>
<PRE>    procedure PUSH(E :  in ELEMENT;  S :  in out STACK);</PRE>
<p>
This  declaration   contains  the   name  of  the  procedure  and  the
specification of  the mode  and type of each formal parameter. This is
the  information  needed  to  specify  the  interface  of  PUSH,  both
syntactically and semantically, at least with regard to type checking.
From this  point of view the declaration conveys all one needs to know
in order  to  call  the  procedure  PUSH.  The  declaration  could  be
augmented by  comments specifying  pre-conditions and  post-conditions
and any exception that might be raised by PUSH.
<p>
Obviously, however,  this formulation of PUSH is incomplete in that it
does not  define an  implementation of  the procedure.  The latter  is
provided by a procedure body:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure PUSH(E :  in ELEMENT;  S :  in out STACK) is
begin
  if S.INDEX = S.SIZE then
    raise STACK_OVERFLOW;
  else
    S.INDEX :=  S.INDEX + 1;
    S.SPACE(S.INDEX) :=  E;
  end if;
end PUSH;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
These two  constructs -  the declaration and the body - jointly define
the procedure. In cases where the advantages of separate specification
are not  essential, the  procedure declaration  may be omitted. In any
case, the  specification of the parameters must always be given in the
body for  reasons of  readability, and also because of the possibility
of overloading:  there could  be push  procedures for items, integers,
and so on.
<p>
A similar  separation is  provided for packages. A package declaration
provides the interface to the user: the visible part. For example, the
declaration of a SIMPLE_IO package is provided as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package SIMPLE_IO is
  type FILE_NAME is limited private;
  procedure CREATE(FILE    :  out    FILE_NAME);
  procedure READ      (ELEM     :  out    INTEGER;  F :  in
FILE_NAME);
  procedure WRITE     (ELEM     :  in     INTEGER;  F :  in
FILE_NAME);
private
  type FILE_NAME is new INTEGER range 0 .. 50;
end SIMPLE_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This declaration  provides the user with the specification of the name
of a  type -  FILE_NAME -  and also  with  the  specification  of  the
associated procedures  CREATE, READ,  and WRITE.  This constitutes the
logical interface of the package.
<p>
The package  implementation is always provided as a textually distinct
package body as shown in the sketch below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package body SIMPLE_IO is
  type FILE_DESCRIPTOR is
    record
      -- components of each file descriptor
    end record;
  DIRECTORY :  array (FILE_NAME) of FILE_DESCRIPTOR;

  -- other local constants, variables and subprograms

  procedure CREATE(FILE  :  out FILE_NAME) is
    ...
  end CREATE;
  procedure READ(ELEM :  out INTEGER;  F :  in FILE_NAME) is ...
end READ;
  procedure WRITE(ELEM :  in INTEGER;  F :  in FILE_NAME) is ...
end WRITE;
end SIMPLE_IO;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
As in  the case of procedures, the package declaration and the package
body jointly  define the  package considered. For pragmatic reasons (a
package  declaration   is  generally  much  larger  than  a  procedure
declaration),  the  package  body  does  not  repeat  the  information
contained in  the package  declaration; furthermore packages cannot be
overloaded and so there is no problem of identification.
<p>
A similar  separation is  also used  for task  units and  for  generic
units.
