<H2>CHAPTER 7: Portability</H2>

<H3><a name="7.7">7.7     Input/Output</a></H3>
Input/Output facilities in Ada are not a part of the syntactic definition of 
the language. The constructs in the language have been used to define a set of 
packages for this purpose. These packages are not expected to meet all the I/O 
needs of all applications, in particular embedded systems. They serve as a 
core subset that may be used on straightforward data, and that can be used as 
examples of building I/O facilities upon the low-level constructs provided by 
the language. Providing an I/O definition that could meet the requirements of 
all applications and integrate with the many existing operating systems would 
result in unacceptable implementation dependencies.<P>
The types of portability problems encountered with I/O tend to be different 
for applications running with a host operating system versus embedded targets 
where the Ada run-time is self-sufficient. Interacting with a host operating 
system offers the added complexity of coexisting with the host file system 
structures (e.g., hierarchical directories), access methods (e.g., ISAM), and 
naming conventions (e.g., logical names and aliases based on the current 
directory).  The section on Input/Output in ARTEWG (1986) provides some 
examples of this type of dependency. Embedded applications have different 
dependencies that often tie them to the low-level details of their hardware 
devices.<P>
The major defense against these inherent implementation dependencies in I/O is 
to try to isolate their functionality in any given application. The majority 
of the following guidelines are focused in this direction.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use constants and variables as symbolic actuals for the
<CODE>Name</CODE> and <CODE>Form</CODE> parameters on the predefined I/O packages.
Declare and initialize them in an implementation dependency package.  
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The format and allowable values of these parameters on the predefined I/O 
packages can vary greatly between implementations. Isolation of these values 
facilitates portability. Note that not specifying a <CODE>Form</CODE> string or using a 
null value does not guarantee portability since the implementation is free to 
specify defaults.

<H4>note</H4>
It may be desirable to further abstract the I/O facilities by defining  
additional <CODE>Create</CODE> and <CODE>Open</CODE> procedures that hide the visibility of the Form  
parameter entirely (see Pappas 1985, 54-55).<P>

states, &quot;The language does not define what happens to external files after completion 
of the main program (in particular, if corresponding files have not been 
closed).&quot; The possibilities range from being closed in an anticipated manner 
to deletion.<P>
The disposition of a closed temporary file may vary, perhaps affecting  
performance and space availability (ARTEWG 1986).<P>

</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983)</a>
does not require  
that it be supported. When such a value is written, it is placed out of reach  
of the implementation. Thus, it is out of reach of the reliability-enhancing 
controls of strong type checking.<P>
Consider the meaning of this operation. One possible implementation of the 
values of access types is virtual addresses. If you write such a value, how 
can you expect another program to read that value and make any sensible use of 
it?  The value cannot be construed to refer to any meaningful location within 
the reader's address space, nor can a reader infer any information about the 
writer's address space from the value read. The latter is the same problem 
that the writer would have trying to interpret or use the value if it is read 
back in. To wit, a garbage collection and/or heap compaction scheme may have 
moved the item formerly accessed by that value, leaving that value &quot;pointing&quot; 
at space which is now being put to indeterminable uses by the underlying 
implementation.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Minimize and isolate using the predefined package Low_Level_IO. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
<CODE>Low_Level_IO</CODE> is intended to support direct interaction with physical devices 
that are usually unique to a given host or target environment. In addition, 
the data types provided to the procedures are implementation-defined. This 
allows vendors to define different interfaces to an identical device.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Those portions of an application that must deal with this level of I/O, e.g.,  
device drivers and real-time components dealing with discretes, are inherently 
nonportable. Where performance allows, structure these components to isolate  
the hardware interface. Only within these isolated portions is it advantageous  
to employ the <CODE>Low_Level_IO</CODE> interface which is portable in concept and general  
procedural interface, if not completely so in syntax and semantics.<P>
