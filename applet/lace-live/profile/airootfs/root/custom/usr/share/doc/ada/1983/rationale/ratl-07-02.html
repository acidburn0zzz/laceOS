<H2>CHAPTER 7: Derived Types</H2>

<H3><a name="7.2">7.2 Informal Introduction to Derived Types</a></H3>

Given some  useful type,  the derivation mechanism offers a simple way
of creating  other types  that  are  distinct  copies  of  this  type.
Consider for example the types:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type SCALAR is digits 8;

type COLOR is (VIOLET, INDIGO, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW, ORANGE, RED);

package METRIC is
  type COORDINATE is
    record
      X  :  SCALAR  :=  0;
      Y  :  SCALAR  :=  0;
      Z  :  SCALAR  :=  0;
    end record;

  function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  COORDINATE) return COORDINATE;
  function "-" (LEFT, RIGHT :  COORDINATE) return COORDINATE;

  procedure INVERT(A :  in out COORDINATE);
end METRIC;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
By derivation we can create the following new types:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MASS   is new SCALAR;
type LENGTH is new SCALAR;
type AREA   is new SCALAR;


type DYE is new COLOR;

type HUE is new COLOR;

type POINT is new METRIC.COORDINATE;
type FORCE is new METRIC.COORDINATE;
type VECTOR is new METRIC.COORDINATE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The motivation  for creating  new types  that are  copies of  existing
types will  be examined  in later  sections. For the time being let us
review the  properties of such types - obtained by derivation. In each
case, the  derived type is a copy of its parent type. This has several
implications concerning  the  type  class,  the  set  of  values,  the
applicable operations, and overloading.

<H4>Type Class:</H4>
<p>
The derived  type belongs  to the  same class as its parent type. Thus
DYE is  an enumeration  type  since  COLOR  is  an  enumeration  type;
similarly, POINT is a record type since COORDINATE is a record type.
<p>
<H4>Set of Values:</H4>
<p>
The set  of values  of the derived type is a copy of the set of values
of its  parent type.  Thus we  have a set of seven values for the type
DYE -  exactly as  for the  parent type  COLOR. There  is a one-to-one
correspondence between  the two sets of values; but these two sets are
nevertheless distinct:  it would  not be possible to assign a value of
type DYE to a variable of type COLOR.
<p>
<H4>Basic Operations:</H4>
<p>
The basic  operations for the derived type are as for the parent type.
For example,  if component selection is available for the parent type,
it is  available for the derived type. Thus selection of the component
Y (by  dot notation)  is available  for the  type POINT  since  it  is
available for the type COORDINATE; similarly aggregates exist for both
types and they use the same notation.
<p>
<H4>Attributes:</H4>
<p>
Attributes are  basic operations,  so the previous rule applies: If an
attribute is  available for  the parent  type, it is available for the
derived type.  Thus the attribute FIRST is available for the type MASS
since it is available for the type SCALAR: the attribute FIRST for the
type MASS  yields a  value of  type MASS;  the attribute FIRST for the
type SCALAR yields a value of type SCALAR. The (implicit) declarations
of these  two attributes  are in  fact as  follows (this  is NOT legal
Ada):
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function SCALAR'FIRST           return SCALAR; -- for the type
SCALAR
function MASS'FIRST             return MASS;   -- for the type MASS
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<H4>Implicit Conversions of Numeric Literals:</H4>
<p>
Implicit conversions  of numeric  literals are  also basic operations.
Hence there exists an implicit conversion of any real literal (such as
1.54) to  the type  MASS since  there exists such a conversion for the
type SCALAR (the parent type of MASS).
<p>
<H4>Enumeration Literals:</H4>
<p>
If a  given enumeration literal exists for the parent type, there is a
corresponding enumeration literal - with the same identifier - for the
derived type.  Thus there  is the  enumeration literal  INDIGO for the
type DYE  since there  is an  enumeration literal  INDIGO for the type
COLOR. The  (implicit) declarations  of these two enumeration literals
are in fact as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function INDIGO return COLOR;   -- for the type COLOR
function INDIGO return DYE; -- for the type DYE
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Thus each literal yields a value of the corresponding type: as we know
already there  is a  correspondence between  the indigo value of COLOR
and that  of DYE,  but they  are distinct values belonging to distinct
types.
<p>
<H4>Predefined Operations:</H4>
<p>
For  each   predefined  operation  of  the  parent  type  there  is  a
corresponding predefined operation of the derived type. For example we
have the addition:
<p>
<PRE>    function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  SCALAR) return SCALAR;</PRE>
<p>
for the  type SCALAR  and hence  the corresponding  additions for  the
derived types:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  MASS)        return MASS;   -- for the type MASS
function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  LENGTH)      return LENGTH; -- for the type LENGTH
function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  AREA)        return AREA;   -- for the type AREA
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<H4>Derivable Operations:</H4>
<p>
For a  type declared in the visible part of a package, each subprogram
that has  a parameter or result of the type and is declared within the
visible  part   of  this   package  is   derivable.  This  means  that
corresponding operations are derived by the derived type. For example,
the package METRIC defines an addition, a subtraction, and a procedure
INVERT  for   the  type   COORDINATE;  and   hence  the  corresponding
subprograms are derived for the type POINT:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function "+" (LEFT, RIGHT :  POINT) return POINT;
function "-" (LEFT, RIGHT :  POINT) return POINT;
procedure INVERT(A :  in out POINT);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note  that   these  derived  operations  are  obtained  by  systematic
substitution of  the name  of the  derived type  for the  name of  the
parent type.
<p>
(We will  say more about the effect of these derived subprograms after
we have presented explicit conversions.)
<p>
<H4>Explicit Conversions:</H4>
<p>
The above  description shows that a derived type is very much like its
parent type.  They are  nevertheless distinct  types.  Thus  with  the
declarations
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
C  :  COLOR :=  INDIGO;
D  :  DYE  :=  VIOLET;
H  :  HUE  :=  RED;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
assignments such as the following are illegal
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
D  :=  H;     -- Illegal: a hue value cannot be assigned to a dye
C  :=  D;     -- Illegal: a dye value cannot be assigned to a color
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
These assignments are not allowed because we are dealing with distinct
types and  distinct sets  of values.  However, there  is a  one-to-one
correspondence between  these sets of values and, for this reason, the
language provides  explicit conversions  between corresponding values.
For example
<p>
<PRE>    DYE(H)</PRE>
<p>
is an  explicit conversion  of the value of H - of type HUE - into the
corresponding value  of type  DYE: here it will yield the RED value of
the type DYE, and so the following assignment is legal
<p>
<PRE>    D :=  DYE(H);</PRE>
<p>
Type conversions between types that are derived directly or indirectly
from each  other (or  from a common parent type) usually do not result
in any  run-time executable  code. Such  conversions are also involved
(implicitly) in  the derivation of a derivable operation. Consider for
example the procedure INVERT:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure INVERT(A :  in out COORDINATE) is
begin
  A.X :=    - A.X;
  A.Y :=    - A.Y;
  A.Z :=    - A.Z;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
and the derivation of the procedure
<p>
<PRE>    procedure INVERT(A :  in out POINT);</PRE>
<p>
The effect of this derived operation is obtained by application of the
parent procedure,  but conversion  of the parameter to the parent type
is assumed  to take  place before the call, and conversion back to the
derived type  is assumed  to take  place after  the call.  Thus for  a
variable P of type POINT, the call
<p>
<PRE>    INVERT(P);</PRE>
<p>
has the same effect as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  use METRIC;
  K :  COORDINATE;
begin
  K :=  COORDINATE(P);  -- convert to parent type
  METRIC.INVERT(K);     -- call parent procedure
  P :=  POINT(K);       -- convert back to derived type
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
or simply
<p>
<PRE>    METRIC.INVERT(METRIC.COORDINATE(K));</PRE>
<p>
but this form does not show the conversion back.
<p>
Here again  these conversions  usually do  not result  in any run-time
executable code  but they  are  needed  to  explain  the  use  of  the
procedure  METRIC.INVERT,   which  is  only  applicable  to  the  type
METRIC.COORDINATE.
<p>
<H4>Overloading considerations:</H4>
<p>
A  final   point  to  consider  with  derived  types  is  overloading.
Derivation creates several overloaded entities. Thus we have
<ul>
<li>Overloaded aggregates. For example, for the types METRIC.COORDINATE
and POINT, the aggregate:  (X =&gt;  1.0, Y =&gt;  2.0, Z =&gt;  1.5)
<p>
<li>Overloaded enumeration  literals. For example, for the types COLOR,
DYE, and  HUE, enumeration  literals such as VIOLET, INDIGO, and so
on.
<p>
<li>Overloaded subprograms.  For example,  the procedure INVERT for the
types POINT,  FORCE, and METRIC.COORDINATE. Similarly, the operator
"+" for these types, for the type SCALAR, and for the types derived
from SCALAR.
</ul>

As usual,  overloaded entities  are identified  by the  context.  Thus
there is no ambiguity in the following cases:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
C  :=  INDIGO;           -- the INDIGO of the type COLOR
D  :=  INDIGO;           -- the INDIGO of the type DYE
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Qualification can  be used  when the context is not sufficient for the
determination of  the meaning  of an overloaded construct. For example
the  following   comparison  is  ambiguous  (and  admittedly  somewhat
pathological):
<p>
<PRE>    if (X =&gt; A,  Y =&gt; B,  Z =&gt; C)  =  (X =&gt; U,  Y =&gt; V,  Z =&gt; W) then -- ambiguous</pre>
<p>
But this  ambiguity can be resolved by qualification of one or of both
aggregates:
<p>
<PRE>    POINT'(X =&gt; A,  Y =&gt; B,  Z =&gt; C)     =  (X =&gt; U,  Y =&gt; V,  Z =&gt; W)</PRE>
<p>
or
<p>
<PRE>   POINT'(X =&gt; A,  Y =&gt; B,  Z =&gt; C)     =   POINT'(X =&gt; U,  Y =&gt; V,  Z   =&gt; W)</PRE>
<p>
or
<p>
<PRE>    (X =&gt; A,  Y =&gt; B,  Z =&gt; C)     =   POINT'(X =&gt; U,  Y =&gt; V,  Z   =&gt; W)</PRE>
<p>
We next review major classes of use of derived types.
