<H2>CHAPTER 4: Types</H2>

<H3><a name="4.4">4.4 Constraints and Subtypes</a></H3>

So far we have seen that a type characterizes a set of values that may
be assumed by objects of the type, and a set of operations that may be
applied to  these values  and objects.  The fact  that an object has a
certain type  is a static property of the program: it follows directly
from the declaration of the object.
<p>
We shall  now see how to restrict the values that may be assumed by an
object to  a subset  of the  values of the type. Such a restriction is
called a  constraint, and  it does  not affect  the set  of applicable
operations.  A   subtype  is   a  type  together  with  an  associated
constraint. An  object can  be declared to have a certain subtype, and
this is  then a  static property of the object. But in general it will
not always  be possible  to determine statically (at compilation time)
whether or not a value satisfies a constraint and thereby belongs to a
corresponding subtype. Thus constraints and subtypes are concepts that
are, in general, related to the dynamic behavior of programs.

<p>

A constraint  can be  used to  restrict the  set of values that may be
assumed by an object of a given type, as in the following example:
<p>
<PRE>    START :  DAY range MON .. WED;
</PRE><p>
Had we declared the variable START as
<p>
<PRE>    START :  DAY;       -- only on MON, TUE, and WED
</PRE><p>
then all  values of  this type  would be  assignable to  START  -  the
comment notwithstanding.  Given  the  constraint,  however,  the  only
assignable values  are those  in the  range MON  .. WED,  that is, the
values MON, TUE, and WED.
<p>
Constraints may  be used  effectively by  compilers  for  optimization
purposes.  Their  major  purpose,  however,  is  for  greater  program
reliability: a  constraint expresses  a  logical  requirement  on  our
program  in  an  explicit  manner,  and  it  therefore  opens  up  the
possibility of  reporting  violations  of  this  logical  requirement,
should they ever occur.
<p>
In principle  these violations  will be  reported at execution time by
raising the  exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR.  This means that, in general,
compilers  will  generate  code  that  dynamically  checks  constraint
satisfaction. In  practice however,  compilers will  be able to report
certain potential  constraint violations at compilation time. In other
situations they  will be  in a  position to  omit a given check, since
success has been guaranteed by a prior check.
<p>
Examples of  assignments are  given in  the block statement below. The
comment static  check refers to situations where the check can be done
at compilation  time (in  anticipation).  The  comment  dynamic  check
refers to situations where a check at run time is actually required.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  TODAY  :  DAY;
  START  :  DAY     range MON .. WED;
  STOP   :  DAY     range MON .. FRI;
  MID    :  DAY     range WED .. THU;
begin
  START  :=  TUE;        -- static check : since TUE is a literal
  STOP   :=  FRI;        -- static check : since FRI is a literal
  ...
  TODAY  :=  START;      -- static check : any value is allowed for TODAY
  STOP   :=  START;      -- static check : the range of STOP
                         --  includes that of START
  ...
  START  :=  STOP;       -- dynamic check : STOP &lt;=  WED
  MID    :=  TODAY;      -- dynamic check : TODAY in WED .. THU
  ...
  STOP   :=  MID;        -- static check : the range of MID is
                         --  included in that of STOP
end;

It is  good programming practice to factor out the knowledge of common
properties, and  this applies  to  constraints  as  well.  Assume  for
example that  at several  places in a program we find objects declared
with a type and constraint such as
<p>
<PRE>    DAY range MON .. FRI
</PRE><p>
Then it  would be  better to  associate a name with this group and use
this name  for the  corresponding object  declarations.  This  can  be
achieved  by  a  subtype  declaration  (a  type  name  followed  by  a
constraint is actually called a subtype indication):
<p>
<PRE>    subtype WORKDAY is DAY range MON .. FRI;</PRE>
<p>
where the  name chosen  for the  subtype is carefully chosen to convey
the intent.
<p>
The name  of a subtype is an abbreviation for the associated type name
and constraint. Thus a subtype declaration does not define a new type,
and objects  of different  subtypes of a given type are compatible for
assignment. In  an expression,  such objects  can be used at any place
where a  value of  the given  type is  expected; the  constraint on an
object need be checked only upon assignment to the object, as shown in
the previous examples.
<p>
The  advantages  of  using  subtypes  are  the  usual  maintainability
advantages of  any factoring  mechanism. For  example, if  we want  to
change the  range of workdays, then a single textual change is needed,
namely in the subtype declaration. Without named subtypes, it would be
necessary to  inspect all  occurrences of  the range MON .. FRI in the
program, in  order to detect those occurrences where the intent was to
use this range for workdays.
<p>
We can  also define  hierarchies of  subtypes  by  constraining  other
subtypes. Consider  for example  the type  CHARACTER. In Ada this is a
predefined enumeration  type whose  enumeration literals are character
literals (such  enumeration types  are called character types). Now we
can define a subtype such as
<p>
<PRE>    subtype LETTER is CHARACTER range 'A' .. 'Z';</PRE>
<p>
for upper-case letters. Subsequently we can define a subtype such as
<p>
<PRE>    subtype LAST_11 is LETTER range 'O' .. 'Z';</PRE>
<p>
For this  to be  correct, the range 'O' .. 'Z' must be compatible with
that of  LETTER, that is, it must be a subinterval of 'A' .. 'Z'. This
is checked,  and so  an error  such as  writing the character '0' (the
digit zero)  instead of  the upper-case letter 'O' would be detected -
the character '0' (zero) does not belong to the range 'A ' .. 'Z'.

<H3><BR><a name="4.4.3">4.4.3 Evaluation of Constraints</a></H3>
<p>

All the  examples presented  so far  included constraints  that can be
evaluated statically.  Certain  constraints  that  determine  critical
space requirements  must be  known at  compilation time,  since  space
optimization would not be possible in the case of dynamically computed
values. For  example, the range of an integer type had better be known
statically, in  order to  allow the compiler to select the appropriate
single-length or double-length machine instructions.
<p>
However, requiring  static evaluation  in every case would be much too
restrictive. The  assertions expressed  by range  constraints would be
too coarse, ranges could not be used as general loop iteration ranges,
and arrays  could only  be of static size. A balance must be struck in
this respect,  and the  rules of  Ada represent a deliberate choice of
when evaluation must be static.
<p>
An issue  to be  considered is the time when the expressions appearing
in constraints should be evaluated. Consider the subtype declaration:
<p>
<PRE>    subtype PAST is DAY range MON .. TODAY;</PRE>
<p>
where TODAY  is a variable. The rule adopted in Ada is that the bounds
of a  range constraint  are evaluated  when the subtype declaration is
elaborated. This  means that  the subtype declaration is equivalent to
the following sequence:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
today_now :  constant DAY  :=  TODAY;
subtype PAST is DAY range MON .. today_now;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
where today_now  represents an  identifier  not  used  elsewhere.  The
bounds of  the subtype  PAST are  denoted by  the  subtype  attributes
PAST'FIRST (same as MON) and PAST'LAST (same as today_now).
<p>
Note that  if the  bounds of  the range  are not  known at compilation
time,  the  compiler  will  often  need  to  generate  (implicitly)  a
descriptor containing  the value  of the  bounds. Hence,  to  minimize
descriptor overhead,  it is  important to localize the knowledge about
equivalent constraints in a single subtype declaration and then to use
the name  of this  subtype, instead  of repeating  the  constraint  in
several variable declarations.
<p>
Note also  that, for  reliability and maintainability, using a subtype
is far  better than  repeating the corresponding constraint at various
points of  the text, since the value of an expression defining a bound
may differ at these points. Thus it is preferable to write:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  subtype INDEX is INTEGER range K&#42;M .. K&#42;N;
  TABLE :  array (INDEX) of FLOAT;
    ...
  procedure UPDATE(X :  INDEX) is
    ...
  end UPDATE;
begin
  for J in INDEX loop
    if TABLE(J) &lt; TABLE(INDEX'LAST) then
      ...
    end if;
  end loop;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
rather than  to repeat  the range  K&#42;M .. K&#42;N at various points of the
text or to use K&#42;N directly (for INDEX'LAST).
<p>
In the  case of the subprogram UPDATE the language does not even leave
us this  choice, since  it requires a type or subtype name for subtype
indications of formal parameters.
