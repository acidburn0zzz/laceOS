<H1>1.3.3 Overview: Structure, visibility, and limited types</H1>
<div class="Normal">Structure is vital for controlling visibility and 
thus abstraction. There were huge changes in Ada 95. The whole of the 
hierarchical child unit mechanism was introduced with both public and 
private children. It was hoped that this would provide sufficient flexibility 
for the future.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">But one problem has 
remained. Suppose we have two types where each wishes to refer to the 
other. Both need to come first! Basically we solve the difficulty by 
using incomplete types. We might have a drawing package concerning points 
and lines in a symmetric way. Each line contains a list or array of the 
points on it and similarly each point contains a list or array of the 
lines through it. We can imagine that they are both derived from some 
root type containing printing information such as color. In Ada 95 we 
might write<A NAME="I1015"></A>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;Object&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;abstract&nbsp;tagged</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its_Color:&nbsp;Color;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;Point;<BR>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;Line;<BR>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;Acc_Point&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;access&nbsp;all</B>&nbsp;Point;<BR>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;Acc_Line&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;access&nbsp;all</B>&nbsp;Line;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>subtype</B>&nbsp;Index&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;<B>range</B>&nbsp;0&nbsp;..&nbsp;Max;<BR>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;Acc_Line_Array&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;array</B>&nbsp;(1&nbsp;..&nbsp;Max)&nbsp;<B>of</B>&nbsp;Acc_Line;<BR>
<B>type</B>&nbsp;Acc_Point_Array&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;array</B>&nbsp;(1&nbsp;..&nbsp;Max)&nbsp;<B>of</B>&nbsp;Acc_Point;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;Point&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;new</B>&nbsp;Object&nbsp;<B>with</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No_Of_Lines:&nbsp;Index;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LL:&nbsp;Acc_Line_Array;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;Line&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;new</B>&nbsp;Object&nbsp;<B>with</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No_Of_Points:&nbsp;Index;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PP:&nbsp;Acc_Point_Array;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="Normal">This is very crude since it assumes a maximum number 
<SPAN Class="swiss">Max</SPAN> of points on a line and vice versa and 
declares the arrays accordingly. The reader can flesh it out more flexibly. 
Well this is all very well but if the individual types get elaborate 
and each has a series of operations, we might want to declare them in 
distinct packages (perhaps child packages of that containing the root 
type). In Ada 95 we cannot do this because both the incomplete declaration 
and its completion have to be in the same package.</div>
<div class="Normal">The net outcome is that we end up with giant cumbersome 
packages.</div>
<div class="Normal">What we need therefore is some way of logically enabling 
the<A NAME="I1016"></A> incomplete view and the completion to be in different 
packages. The elderly might remember that in the 1980 version of Ada 
the situation was even worse &ndash; the completion had to be in the 
same list of declarations as the incomplete declaration. Ada 83 relaxed 
this (the so-called Taft Amendment) and permits the private part and 
body to be treated as one list &ndash; the same rule applies in Ada 95. 
We now go one step further.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Ada 2005 solves the 
problem by introducing a variation on the with clause &ndash; the limited 
with clause.<A NAME="I1017"></A><A NAME="I1018"></A> The idea is that 
a library package (and subprogram) can refer to another library package 
that has not yet been declared and can refer to the types in that package 
but only as if they were incomplete types. Thus we might have a root 
package <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry</SPAN> containing the declarations 
of <SPAN Class="swiss">Object</SPAN>, <SPAN Class="swiss">Max</SPAN>, 
<SPAN Class="swiss">Index</SPAN>, and so on and then&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>limited&nbsp;with</B>&nbsp;Geometry.Lines;<BR>
<B>package</B>&nbsp;Geometry.Points&nbsp;<B>is</B></div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;Acc_Line_Array&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;array</B>&nbsp;(1&nbsp;..&nbsp;Max)&nbsp;<B>of&nbsp;access</B>&nbsp;Lines.Line;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;Point&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;new</B>&nbsp;Object&nbsp;<B>with</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No_Of_Lines:&nbsp;Index;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LL:&nbsp;Acc_Line_Array;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;Geometry.Points;</div>
<div class="Normal">The package <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry.Lines</SPAN> 
is declared in a similar way. Note especially that we are using the anonymous 
access type facility discussed in Section <A HREF="Rat-1-3-2.html">1.3.2</A> 
and so we do not even have to declare named access types such as <SPAN Class="swiss">Acc_Line</SPAN> 
in order to declare <SPAN Class="swiss">Acc_Line_Array</SPAN>.</div>
<div class="Normal">By writing <B>limited with</B> <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry.Lines;</SPAN> 
we get access to all the types visible in the specification of <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry.Lines</SPAN> 
but as if they were declared as incomplete. In other words we get an 
incomplete view of the types. We can then do all the things we can normally 
do with incomplete types such as use them to declare access types. (Of 
course the implementation checks later that <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry.Lines</SPAN> 
does actually have a type <SPAN Class="swiss">Line</SPAN>.)</div>
<div class="Normal">Not only is the absence of the need for a named type 
<SPAN Class="swiss">Acc_Line</SPAN> a handy shorthand, it also prevents 
the proliferation of named access types. If we did want to use a named 
type <SPAN Class="swiss">Acc_Line</SPAN> in both packages then we would 
have to declare a distinct type in each package. This is because from 
the point of view of the package <SPAN Class="swiss">Points</SPAN>, the 
<SPAN Class="swiss">Acc_Line</SPAN> in <SPAN Class="swiss">Lines</SPAN> 
would only be an incomplete type (remember each package only has a limited 
view of the other) and thus would be essentially unusable. The net result 
would be many named access types and wretched type conversions all over 
the place.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">There are also some 
related changes to the notation for incomplete types. We can now write 
</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;T&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;tagged</B>;</div>
<div class="Normal">and we are then guaranteed that the full declaration 
will reveal <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> to be a tagged type. The advantage 
is that we also know that, being tagged, objects of the type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> 
will be passed by reference. Consequently we can use the type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> 
for parameters before seeing its full declaration. In the example of 
points and lines above, since <SPAN Class="swiss">Line</SPAN> is visibly 
tagged in the package <SPAN Class="swiss">Geometry.Lines</SPAN> we will 
thus get an incomplete tagged view of Lines.<A NAME="I1019"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The introduction of 
tagged incomplete types clarifies the ability to write&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;T_Ptr&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;access&nbsp;all</B>&nbsp;T'Class;</div>
<div class="Normal">This was allowed in Ada 95 even though we had not 
declared T as tagged at this point. Of course it implied that T would 
be tagged. In Ada 2005 this is frowned upon since we should now declare 
that T is tagged incomplete if we wish to declare a class wide access 
type. For compatibility the old feature has been retained but banished 
to <A HREF="http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/05rm/html/RM-J-11.html">Annex 
J</A> for obsolescent features.</div>
<div class="Normal">Further examples of the use of limited with clauses 
will be found in Section <A HREF="Rat-4-2.html">4.2</A>.</div>
<div class="Normal">Another enhancement in this area is the introduction 
of private with clauses which overcome a problem with private child packages.<A NAME="I1020"></A><A NAME="I1021"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Private child packages 
were introduced to enable the details of the implementation of part of 
a system to be decomposed and yet not be visible to the external world. 
However, it is often convenient to have public packages that use these 
details but do not make them visible to the user. In Ada 95 a parent 
or sibling body can have a with clause for a private child. But the specifications 
cannot. These rules are designed to ensure that information does not 
leak out via the visible part of a specification. But there is no logical 
reason why the private part of a package should not have access to a 
private child. Ada 2005 overcomes this by introducing private with clauses. 
We can write&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>private&nbsp;package</B>&nbsp;App.Secret_Details&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;Inner&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>various&nbsp;operations&nbsp;on&nbsp;Inner&nbsp;etc</I></SPAN><BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;App.Secret_Details;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>private&nbsp;with</B>&nbsp;App.Secret_Details;<BR>
<B>package</B>&nbsp;App.User_View&nbsp;<B>is</B></div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;Outer&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;private</B>;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>various&nbsp;operations&nbsp;on&nbsp;Outer&nbsp;visible&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;user</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>type&nbsp;Inner&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;visible&nbsp;here</I></SPAN><BR>
<B>private</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>type&nbsp;Inner&nbsp;is&nbsp;visible&nbsp;here</I></SPAN></div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;Outer&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X:&nbsp;Secret_Details.Inner;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;App.User_View;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">thus the private part 
of the public child has access to the type <SPAN Class="swiss">Inner</SPAN> 
but it is still hidden from the external user. Note that the public child 
and private child might have mutually declared types as well in which 
case they might also wish to use the limited with facility. In this case 
the public child would have a limited private with clause for the private 
child written thus<A NAME="I1022"></A><A NAME="I1023"></A>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>limited&nbsp;private&nbsp;with</B>&nbsp;App.Secret_Details;<BR>
<B>package</B>&nbsp;App.User_View&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;...</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">In the case of a parent 
package, its specification cannot have a with clause for a child &ndash; 
logically the specification cannot know about the child because the parent 
must be declared (that is put into the program library) first. Similarly 
a parent cannot have a private with clause for a private child. But it 
can have a limited with clause for any child (thereby breaking the circularity) 
and in particular it can have a limited private with clause for a private 
child. So we might also have&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>limited&nbsp;private&nbsp;with</B>&nbsp;App.Secret_Details;<BR>
<B>package</B>&nbsp;App&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;...</div>
<div class="Normal">The final topic in this section is limited types. 
The reader will recall that the general idea of a limited type is to 
restrict the operations that the user can perform on a type to just those 
provided by the developer of the type and in particular to prevent the 
user from doing assignment and thus making copies of an object of the 
type.</div>
<div class="Normal">However, limited types have never quite come up to 
expectation both in Ada 83 and Ada 95. Ada 95 brought significant improvements 
by disentangling the concept of a limited type from a private type but 
problems have remained.</div>
<div class="Normal">The key problem is that Ada 95 does not allow the 
initialization of limited types because of the view that initialization 
requires assignment and thus copying. A consequence is that we cannot 
declare constants of a limited type either. Ada 2005 overcomes this problem 
by allowing initialization by aggregates.<A NAME="I1024"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">As a simple example, 
consider&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;T&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;limited</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A:&nbsp;Integer;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B:&nbsp;Boolean;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:&nbsp;Float;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">in which the type as 
a whole is limited but the components are not. If we declare an object 
of type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> in Ada 95 then we have to initialize 
the components (by assigning to them) individually thus&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X:&nbsp;T;<BR>
<B>begin</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.A&nbsp;:=&nbsp;10;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.B&nbsp;:=&nbsp;True;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.C&nbsp;:=&nbsp;45.7;</div>
<div class="Normal">Not only is this annoying but it is prone to errors 
as well. If we add a further component <SPAN Class="swiss">D</SPAN> to 
the record type <SPAN Class="swiss">T</SPAN> then we might forget to 
initialize it. One of the advantages of aggregates is that we have to 
supply all the components (allowing automatic so-called full coverage 
analysis, a key benefit of Ada).<A NAME="I1025"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Ada 2005 allows the 
initialization with aggregates thus</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X:&nbsp;T&nbsp;:=&nbsp;(A&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;10,&nbsp;&nbsp;B&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;True,&nbsp;&nbsp;C&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;45.7);</div>
<div class="Normal">Technically, Ada 2005 just recognizes properly that 
initialization is not assignment. Thus we should think of the individual 
components as being initialized individually <I>in situ</I> &ndash; an 
actual aggregated value is not created and then assigned. (Much the same 
happens when initializing controlled types with an aggregate.)<A NAME="I1026"></A></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Sometimes a limited 
type has components where an initial value cannot be given. This happens 
with task and protected types. For example&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>protected&nbsp;type</B>&nbsp;Semaphore&nbsp;<B>is</B>&nbsp;...&nbsp;;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>type</B>&nbsp;PT&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>record</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guard:&nbsp;Semaphore;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count:&nbsp;Integer;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished:&nbsp;Boolean&nbsp;:=&nbsp;False;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;record</B>;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Remember that a protected 
type is inherently limited. This means that the type <SPAN Class="swiss">PT</SPAN> 
is limited because a type with a limited component is itself limited. 
It is good practice to explicitly put <B>limited</B> on the type <SPAN Class="swiss">PT</SPAN> 
in such cases but it has been omitted here for illustration. Now we cannot 
give an explicit initial value for a <SPAN Class="swiss">Semaphore</SPAN> 
 but we would still like to use an aggregate to get the coverage check. 
In such cases we can use the box symbol <SPAN Class="swiss">&lt;&gt;</SPAN> 
to mean use the default value for the type (if any). So we can write<A NAME="I1027"></A><A NAME="I1028"></A> 
</div>
<div class="SwissExamples">X:&nbsp;PT&nbsp;:=&nbsp;(Guard&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;,&nbsp;Count&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;0,&nbsp;Finished&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;);</div>
<div class="Normal">Note that the ability to use <SPAN Class="swiss">&lt;&gt;</SPAN> 
in an aggregate for a default value is not restricted to the initialization 
of limited types. It is a new feature applicable to aggregates in general. 
But, in order to avoid confusion, it is only permitted with named notation.</div>
<div class="Normal">Limited aggregates are also allowed in other similar 
contexts where copying is not involved including as actual parameters 
of mode <B>in</B>.</div>
<div class="Normal">There are also problems with returning results of 
a limited type from a function. This is overcome in Ada 2005 by the introduction 
of an extended form of return statement. This is described in detail 
in Section <A HREF="Rat-4-5.html">4.5</A>.</div>
