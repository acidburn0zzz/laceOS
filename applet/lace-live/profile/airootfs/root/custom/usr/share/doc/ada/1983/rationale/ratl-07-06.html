<H2>CHAPTER 7: Derived Types</H2>

<H3><a name="7.6">7.6 The Construction of Private Types</a></H3>

For the  construction of  private types, derived types provide an easy
and unambiguous  way of  distinguishing the  operations of the private
type from  those of the type used for its representation (that is, the
type declared by the full type declaration). The relevant aspects are:
(1) the  fact that the parent and the derived type are distinct types;
(2) the fact that explicit conversions between the two types exist.
<p>
Consider for  example the  case where  an operation  specified  for  a
private type  is implemented in terms of an operation of the type that
is used for representing the private type:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package LOCKSMITH is
  type KEY is private;
  procedure GET_KEY(K :  out KEY);
  ...
  function "&lt;" (X, Y :  KEY) return BOOLEAN;
private
  type KEY is new CHARACTER;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The user need not know that keys are implemented as characters, but he
is provided  with the  operator "&lt;"  to order  keys. This  operator is
implemented as the comparison of the corresponding characters:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package body LOCKSMITH is
  ...
  function "&lt;" (X, Y :  KEY) return BOOLEAN is
  begin
    return CHARACTER(X) &lt; CHARACTER(Y);
  end;
  ...
end LOCKSMITH;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The function first converts the parameters X and Y into characters and
then compares  them using character comparison. (Note that X &lt; Y would
not work: it would be a recursive call.)
<p>
A more  general example  of this  problem is provided by the following
schema
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package P is
  type T is private;
  function F(X :  T) return T;
private
  type T is new REP;
  <HR> there exists a function F operating on REP
end P;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In order  to implement  the function F on T by means of that on REP we
first convert  the parameter  to the type REP; then convert the result
back to type T.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package body P is
  ...
  function F(X :  T) return T is
  begin
    return T(F(REP(X)));
  end;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Without derivation,  a solution  can be  developed using one-component
records:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package P is
  type T is private;
  function F(X :  T) return T;
private
  type T is
    record
      VALUE :  REP;
    end record;
end;

package body P is
  ...
  function F(X :  T) return T is
  begin
    return T'(VALUE =&gt;  F(X.VALUE));
  end;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The function  F is  applied to  the single component of the parameter;
then a one-component aggregate is returned as the function result. The
drawback of this solution is its lack of symmetry. Thus, compare
<p>
<PRE>    return T(F(REP(X)));</PRE>
<p>
with
<p>
<PRE>    return T'(VALUE =&gt;  F(X.VALUE));</PRE>
<p>
Instead of the succession of two conversions - to REP and then back to
T - we have now the succession of component selection (X.VALUE) and of
aggregate construction T'(VALUE =&gt; ...  ). Note that there are already
cases where  the language requires one-component records (for implicit
initializations). For  the remaining cases, however, the solution with
derived types is more elegant.
