<H3><a name="5.8">5.8     Using Exceptions</a></H3>
Ada exceptions are a reliability-enhancing language feature designed to help 
specify program behavior in the presence of errors or unexpected events.  
Exceptions are not intended to provide a general purpose control construct.  
Further, liberal use of exceptions should not be considered sufficient for  
providing full software fault tolerance (Melliar-Smith and Randall 1987).<P>
This section addresses the issues of how and when to avoid raising exceptions, 
how and where to handle them, and whether to propagate them. Information on 
how to use exceptions as part of the interface to a unit include what 
exceptions to declare and raise and under what conditions to raise them. 
Other issues are addressed in Guidelines <a href="sty-04-03.html#4.3">4.3</a> and <a href="sty-07-05.html#7.5">7.5</a>.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid causing exceptions to be raised when it is easy and efficient to  do so. 
<li>Provide handlers for exceptions which cannot be avoided. 
<li>Use exception handlers to enhance readability by separating fault  
handling from normal execution. 
<li>Do not use exceptions and exception handlers as goto statements. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
In many cases, it is possible to detect easily and efficiently that an 
operation you are about to perform would raise an exception. In such a case, 
it is a good idea to check rather than allowing the exception to be raised and 
handling it with an exception handler. For example, check each pointer for 
<CODE>NULL</CODE> when traversing a linked list of records connected by pointers. Also, 
test an integer for zero before dividing by it, and call an interrogative 
function <CODE>Stack_Is_Empty</CODE> before invoking the <CODE>POP</CODE> procedure of a stack package. 
Such tests are appropriate when they can be performed easily and efficiently, 
as a natural part of the algorithm being implemented.<P>
However, error detection in advance is not always so simple. There are cases 
where such a test is too expensive or too unreliable. In such cases, it is 
better to attempt the operation within the scope of an exception handler so 
that the exception is handled if it is raised. For example, in the case of a 
linked list implementation of a list, it is very inefficient to call a 
function <CODE>Entry_Exists</CODE> before each call to the procedure <CODE>Modify_Entry</CODE> simply to 
avoid raising the exception <CODE>Entry_Not_Found</CODE>. It takes as much time to search 
the list to avoid the exception as it takes to search the list to perform the 
update.  Similarly, it is much easier to attempt a division by a real number 
within the scope of an exception handler to handle numeric overflow than to 
test in advance whether the dividend is too large or the divisor too small for 
the quotient to be representable on the machine.<P>
In concurrent situations, tests done in advance can also be unreliable. For 
example, if you want to modify an existing file on a multi-user system, it is 
safer to attempt to do so within the scope of an exception handler than to 
test in advance whether the file exists, whether it is protected, whether 
there is room in the file system for the file to be enlarged, etc. Even if you 
tested for all possible errors conditions, there is no guarantee that nothing 
would change after the test and before the modification operation. You still 
need the exception handlers, so the advance testing serves no purpose.<P>
Whenever such a case does not apply, normal and predictable events should be  
handled by the code without the abnormal transfer of control represented by an  
exception. When fault handling and only fault handling code is included in  
exception handlers, the separation makes the code easier to read. The reader  
can skip all the exception handlers and still understand the normal flow of  
control of the code. For this reason, exceptions should never be raised and  
handled within the same unit, as a form of a goto statement to exit from a  
loop, if, case, or block statement.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use caution when programming handlers for <CODE>others</CODE>. 
<li>Provide a handler for <CODE>others</CODE> in suitable frames to protect against  
unexpected exceptions being propagated without bound, especially in safety  
critical systems. 
<li>Use <CODE>others</CODE> only to catch exceptions you cannot enumerate explicitly,  
preferably only to flag a potential abort. 
<li>Avoid using <CODE>others</CODE> during development. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Providing a handler for <CODE>others</CODE> allows you to follow the other guidelines in 
this section. It affords a place to catch and convert truly unexpected 
exceptions that were not caught by the explicit handlers. While it may be 
possible to provide &quot;fire walls&quot; against unexpected exceptions being 
propagated without providing handlers in every block, you can convert the 
unexpected exceptions as soon as they arise. The <CODE>others</CODE> handler cannot 
discriminate between different exceptions, and, as a result, any such handler 
must treat the exception as a disaster. Even such a disaster can still be 
converted into a user-defined exception at that point. Since a handler for 
<CODE>others</CODE> catches any exception not otherwise handled explicitly, one placed in 
the frame of a task or of the main subprogram affords the opportunity to 
perform final clean-up and to shut down cleanly.<P>
Programming a handler for <CODE>others</CODE> requires caution because it cannot  
discriminate either which exception was actually raised or precisely where it  
was raised. Thus, the handler cannot make any assumptions about what can be or  
even what needs to be &quot;fixed.&quot;<P>
The use of handlers for <CODE>others</CODE> during development, when exception occurrences  
can be expected to be frequent, can hinder debugging. It is much more  
informative to the developer to see a traceback with the actual exception  
listed than the converted exception. Furthermore, many tracebacks do not list  
the point where the original exception was raised if it was caught by a  
handler.

<H4>note</H4>
The arguments in the preceding paragraph apply only to development time, when  
traceback listings are useful. They are not useful to users and can be  
dangerous. The handler should be included in comment form at the outset of  
development and the double dash removed before delivery.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Handle all exceptions, both user and predefined. 
<li> For every exception that might be raised, provide a handler in 
suitable frames to protect against undesired propagation outside the 
abstraction. 
</UL>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The statement that &quot;it can never happen&quot; is not an acceptable programming 
approach. You must assume it can happen and be in control when it does. You  
should provide defensive code routines for the &quot;cannot get here&quot; conditions.<P>
Some existing advice calls for catching and propagating any exception to the  
calling unit. This advice can stop a program. You should catch the exception  
and propagate it, or a substitute, only if your handler is at the wrong  
abstraction level to effect recovery. Effecting recovery can be difficult, but  
the alternative is a program that does not meet its specification.<P>
Making an explicit request for termination implies that your code is in 
control of the situation and has determined that to be the only safe course of 
action.  Being in control affords opportunities to shut down in a controlled 
manner (clean up loose ends, close files, release surfaces to manual control, 
sound alarms), and implies that all available programmed attempts at recovery 
have been made.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Do not rely on being able to identify the fault raising predefined or  
implementation-defined exceptions. 
<li>Use blocks to associate localized sections of code with their own  
exception handlers. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
See <a href="sty-05-06.html#5.6.9">Guideline 5.6.9</a>.

<H4>rationale</H4>
It is very difficult to determine in an exception handler exactly which  
statement and which operation within that statement raised an exception,  
particularly the predefined and implementation-defined exceptions. The 
predefined and implementation-defined exceptions are candidates for conversion 
and propagation to higher abstraction levels for handling there. User-defined 
exceptions, being more closely associated with the application, are better  
candidates for recovery within handlers.<P>
User-defined exceptions can also be difficult to localize. Associating 
handlers with small blocks of code helps to narrow the possibilities, making 
it easier to program recovery actions. The placement of handlers in small 
blocks within a subprogram or task body also allows resumption of the 
subprogram or task after the recovery actions. If you do not handle exceptions 
within blocks, the only action available to the handlers is to shut down the 
task or subprogram as prescribed in <a href="#5.8.3">Guideline 5.8.3</a>.

<H4>note</H4>
The optimal size for the sections of code you choose to protect by a block and  
its exception handlers is very application-dependent. Too small a granularity 
forces you to expend much more effort in programming for abnormal actions than  
for the normal algorithm. Too large a granularity reintroduces the problems of  
determining what went wrong and of resuming normal flow.<P>
