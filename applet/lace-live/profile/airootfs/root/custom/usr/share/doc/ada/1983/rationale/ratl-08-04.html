<H2>CHAPTER 8: Subprograms</H2>

<H3><a name="8.4">8.4 Function Subprograms</a></H3>

The purpose  of a  function is  to calculate  a  value.  This  is  the
conventional mathematical  meaning of  a function.  Small functions to
access complex  data structures are an essential feature of structured
programming: Not  only do  they hide  irrelevant  parts  of  the  data
structure but they provide a cleaner interface to the outside world.
<p>
Although the mathematical origin of the function concept is clear, its
incorporation  into   a  programming  language  can  lead  to  several
different formulations  depending on  what operations  are allowed  on
variables. Different  levels of restriction can be considered, leading
to different concepts of function:
<ol>
<li>Reading global variables is not allowed.

<li>Reading global variables is allowed but updating them is not.

<li>Reading and updating global variables is allowed.
</ol>

The first  level corresponds  to the  mathematical notion of function;
there are no implicit parameters in the guise of global variables, and
two function  calls with  the same  arguments always  deliver the same
result. However the class of cases in which such functions can be used
is rather limited.
<p>
The second  level has  interesting mathematical properties that can be
used for  code optimization. For example, if F is such a function then
for evaluation of an expression such as
<p>
<PRE>    F + F</PRE>
<p>
the function  need only  be called once. However this kind of function
would not  be allowed  to perform  input-output (since this is a side-
effect), and  instrumentation (by update of a global counter upon each
call) would not be possible.
<p>
The third  level allows  functions such as random number generators or
memo functions, which modify the global environment. Such functions do
not have  the aforementioned properties. If for example RANDOM is such
a function, then 2&#42;RANDOM is not necessarily equal to RANDOM + RANDOM.
<p>
In an  earlier version  of Ada  - <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">the Green language</a> - we attempted to
provide a  formulation of  functions that  corresponds to  the  second
level, but  experimenting with  this concept has shown that this would
exclude many  benevolent side-effects.  For example,  it  led  to  the
imposition of limitations on access variables (since the invocation of
an allocator  is a  kind of  side-effect). Furthermore,  checking  for
functionality could  require reconsideration of the text of separately
compiled compilation units.
<p>
These conceptual  and implementation  difficulties led  to the present
more pragmatic definition, which corresponds to the third level.
<p>
The only  limitation imposed  in Ada  on functions is that the mode of
all parameters  must be in: it would not be logical to allow in out or
out parameters  for functions  in  a  language  that  excludes  nested
assignments within an expression.
<p>
This means  that optimization  of expressions  such as  F +  F will be
achieved only  when the  compiler can conclude that there are no side-
effects that matter.
<p>
For multiple  calls of  functions within an expression, Ada follows an
approach of collaterality as described in <a href="ratl-03-08.html#3.8">section 3.8</a>. This means that
the language  does not define in which order to call F, G, and H in an
expression such as
<p>
<PRE>    F + G + H</PRE>
<p>
The language  rules state  that this  evaluation must  be done in some
order -  that is,  not in  parallel - but this order is not defined by
the language,  so that  the meaning  of a program for which this order
matters is not defined.
<p>
This  semantics  reflects  a  pragmatic  view  of  side-effects,  once
expressed by Brian Higman <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Hi 63]</a>:
<p>
The plain  fact of  the matter  is (1) that side-effects are sometimes
necessary,  and  (2)  programmers  who  are  irresponsible  enough  to
introduce side-effects  unnecessarily will soon lose the confidence of
their colleagues, and rightly so.
