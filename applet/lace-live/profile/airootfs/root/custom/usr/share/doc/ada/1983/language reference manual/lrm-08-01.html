<H2><A NAME="8.1">8.1</A>.  Declarative Region  </H2>
<A HREF="lrm-08.html#8"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="lrm-08-02.html#8.2"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
A  declarative  region  is  a  portion  of  the  program  text.   A  single
declarative region is formed by the text of each of the following: 
<ul>
<li>A subprogram declaration, a package declaration, a  task  declaration,
or  a  generic  declaration,  together with the corresponding body, if
any.  If the body is a body stub, the declarative region also includes
the corresponding subunit.  If the program unit has subunits, they are
also included.<br><br> 
<li>An  entry  declaration  together   with   the   corresponding   accept
statements.<br><br> 
<li>A record type declaration, together with a  corresponding  private  or
incomplete  type declaration if any, and together with a corresponding
record representation clause if any.<br><br> 
<li>A renaming declaration that includes  a  formal  part,  or  a  generic
parameter  declaration  that  includes  either  a  formal  part  or  a
discriminant part.<br><br> 
<li>A block statement or a loop statement. 
</ul>
<P>
In each of the above cases, the declarative region is said to be associated
with the corresponding declaration or statement.  A declaration is said  to
occur  immediately  within  a  declarative  region  if  this  region is the
innermost  region  that  encloses  the  declaration,   not   counting   the
declarative region (if any) associated with the declaration itself. 
<P>
A  declaration  that occurs immediately within a declarative region is said   
to be local to the region.  Declarations in outer (enclosing)  regions  are
said  to  be  global  to  an  inner (enclosed) declarative region.  A local
entity is one declared by a local declaration;   a  global  entity  is  one
declared by a global declaration.  
<P>
Some  of  the  above  forms  of declarative region include several disjoint
parts (for example, other declarative items can be between the  declaration
of  a  package  and  its  body).   Each  declarative region is nevertheless
considered as a (logically) continuous portion of the program text.   Hence
if  any  rule defines  a portion of text as the text that extends from some
specific point of a declarative region to the end of this region, then this
portion is the corresponding subset of the declarative region (for  example
it does not include intermediate declarative items between the two parts of
a package).                                                                         
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
As   defined   in   section   <a href="lrm-03-01.html#3.1">3.1</a>,  the  term  declaration  includes  basic
declarations, implicit declarations, and those declarations that  are  part
of   basic   declarations,   for   example,   discriminant   and  parameter
specifications.  It follows from the definition  of  a  declarative  region
that  a  discriminant  specification  occurs  immediately within the region
associated with  the  enclosing  record  type  declaration.   Similarly,  a
parameter  specification  occurs  immediately  within the region associated
with the enclosing subprogram body or accept statement. 
<P>
The package STANDARD forms a declarative region which encloses all  library  
units:   the  implicit declaration of each library unit is assumed to occur
immediately within this package (see sections <a href="lrm-08-06.html#8.6">8.6</a> and <a href="lrm-10-01.html#10.1.1">10.1.1</a>). 
<P>
Declarative regions can be nested within other  declarative  regions.   For
example,  subprograms,  packages,  task  units,  generic  units,  and block
statements can be nested within each other, and  can  contain  record  type
declarations, loop statements, and accept statements.
