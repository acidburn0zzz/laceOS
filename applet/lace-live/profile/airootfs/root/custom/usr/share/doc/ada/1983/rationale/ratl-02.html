<H2><a name="2">CHAPTER 2: Lexical and Textual Structure</a></H2>

A program is a text that specifies actions to be performed by a
computer.
<p>
Programs are written by human programmers, and read by their authors
or by other programmers for checking and maintenance purposes; they
are also processed by compilers and other automatic tools. The need to
accommodate these various forms of communication permeates every level
of consideration of a programming language, including the most
immediate levels where we are only concerned with the physical
appearance of a program text.
<p>
The lexical and textual structures of a programming language are of
course important for ease of program compilation, and for compilation-
time detection of errors. The importance of lexical and textual
structures is even greater for ease of reading and understanding
programs - in particular, for detection of logical errors - and for
ease of teaching the language. We believe that our understanding of
programs can be greatly simplified if our intuition is able to rely on
textual forms that convey the logical structure of the program. This
is the justification for giving major consideration to readability and
teachability in the design of lexical and textual structures in Ada;
moreover, special attention has been devoted to structural analogies.
