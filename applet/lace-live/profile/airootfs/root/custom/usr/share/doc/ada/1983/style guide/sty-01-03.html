As an experienced programmer you are already writing code that conforms to 
many of the guidelines in this book. In some areas, however, you may have 
adopted a personal programming style that differs from that presented here, 
and you might be reluctant to change. Carefully review those guidelines that 
are inconsistent with your current style, make sure that you understand their 
rationale, and consider adopting them. The overall set of guidelines in this 
book embodies a consistent approach to producing high-quality programs that 
would be weakened by too many exceptions.
<P>
Another important reason for general adoption of common guidelines is 
consistency. If all the staff of a project write source text in the same 
style, many critical project activities are easier. Consistent code simplifies 
formal and informal code reviews, system integration, within-project code 
reuse, and the provision and application of supporting tools. In practice, 
corporate or project standards may require deviations from the guidelines to 
be explicitly commented, so adopting a nonstandard approach may require extra 
work.
