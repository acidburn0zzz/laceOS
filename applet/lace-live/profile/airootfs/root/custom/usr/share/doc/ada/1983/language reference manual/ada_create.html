Fixed links and markup to corrected noticed problems; updated changed pages to
pass the Tidy HTML style checker.

<H2>September 1995: "Integrated Ada '83 Reference Manual"</H2>
This version of the Ada '83 LRM is the hub
of a new "Integrated Ada '83 Reference Manual".
This on-line hypertext resource is comprised of
special HTML versions of the Ada '83 Language Reference Manual,
the Ada '83 Rationale, and the Ada '83 Style Guide that have been
cross-referenced via live hypertext links.
At the end of most first- and second-level sections of this LRM
you'll find sets of links to related sections of both the Rationale 
and the Style Guide, in addition to extensive internal
links to related LRM sections. There are corresponding links
from Style Guide sections to related topic areas in the LRM.
<p>
For comprehensive information on any language topic a reader can now
start from either the Style Guide or the LRM
and pull together applicable style guidelines,
authoritative descriptions of language constructs,
and explanations of the decisions that shaped
the language's advanced architecture.

<H2>August 1995: New LRM Version for AdaIC</H2>
This version of the HTML Ada '83 LRM was created in August 1995 for 
the Ada Information Clearinghouse. 
It was derived from an HTML version done by Gregg Hanna when he was at SAIC.
I'd like to thank Gregg, but his links are broken;
if anyone knows his whereabouts please
<a href="mailto://irvingj@sw-eng.falls-church.va.us">let me know</a>.
<p>
Changes and additions in this version:
<ul>
<li>Added live-linked "Style Guide references" at the end of most LRM subsections. These were generated from the '83 Style Guide's
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/docs/style-guide/83style/html/sty-A.html">Appendix A "Map from LRM to Style Guide"</a>.
<li>Converted in-line LRM section references into live HTML links.
<li>Converted section headings in the Appendix E Syntax Summary into live links.
<li>Added new section headers and footers.
</ul>
The rest of the notes below are from Gregg's version 2.4.

<dl>
<dt>Lionel Cons'
<dd>Creator of the fine <I>texi2html</I> that was used in version 1.0 of the HTML LRM.
<dt>Larry Wall
<dd>Author of <I>PERL</I>, the <B>P</B>ractical <B>E</B>xtraction and <B>R</B>eport <B>L</B>anguage,
which made the required high-octane pattern matching and string replacement much easier.
<dt>Magnus Kempe
<dd>Maintainer of the <A HREF="http://www.adahome.com">Ada WWW Server at <I>EPFL</I></A>
for the nifty picture of Ada Lovelace.
<dt>Ada Joint Program Office
<dd>Provider of the raw text of the LRM and the usage statement that allows this
hyper-document to be created.  A fine model for other endeavors, IMHO.
</dl>

<H2>Creation</H2>

This HTML Ada83 LRM was generated by passing the source of the
LRM through various custom <I>perl</I> scripts written by
<A HREF="mailto:gregor@kafka.saic.com">gregor@kafka.saic.com</A>
which added <I>HTML</I> annotations
to the file.<p>

Processing was accomplished in these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Place <I>HTML</I> anchors at appropriate points and add <I>HTML</I> cross-references.
<LI>Detect and format examples, enumerated lists, bulletted lists, tables, and reference blocks.
<LI>Split the single <I>HTML</I> document into separate chapters and fix references.
<LI>Sub-divide the still huge index into sub-chapter files.
</OL>

<H2>File Layout</H2>
Division of the LRM was necessary due to it's size.  The LRM is split into the following parts:

<dl>
<dt>lrm-[01][0-9].html
<dd>Chapter files numbered <I>00</I> to <I>15</I>.
<dt>lrm-[01][0-9]-[01][0-9].html
<dd>Sub-sections for each chapter.
<DT>lrm-IDX.html
<DD>Main entry point for the index.
<DT>lrm-IDX-[A-V].html
<DD>File for individual sections of the index.
<DT>lrm-IDX-WXYZ.html
<DD>The rest of the index.
<DT>lrm-FORE.html
<DD>The forward.
</DL>

Sections within each chapter file have anchors which are named the
same as the section number.  For example <I>LRM</I> section 3.2 has an <I>HTML</I>
anchor named "3.2".  An <I>URL</I> can be constructed to jump to any section
in the <I>LRM</I>, simply append a reference to the appropriate anchor to a
reference to the appropriate chapter/subsection file.  As an example the
aforementioned <I>LRM</I> section 3.2 could be accessed with the <I>URL</I>
"lrm-03-02.html#3.2", and section 3.2.1 could be accessed with
"lrm-03-02.html#3.2.1".
