<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.12">3.12 Loop Statements</a></H3>

The main  form of  loop statement  allows conditional or unconditional
exit statements  to appear  anywhere within the sequence of statements
enclosed by the brackets loop and end loop:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
loop
  READ_CHARACTER(NEXT);
  exit when NEXT = '&#42;';
  PRINT_CHARACTER(NEXT);
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Although this  form of  loop is  quite general,  a special  form  also
exists to  single out  the cases  in which  a  continuation  condition
appears at the start of the loop:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
while MORE_TO_DO loop
  ...
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Similarly two  forms of  for loop  are provided to iterate over ranges
either in normal (increasing) or in reverse (decreasing) order:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
for COUNTER in 1 .. 10 loop                                         
-- 1 2 3  ...  9 10
  ...
end loop;

for COUNTER in reverse 1 .. 10 loop           -- 10 9 8  ...  2 1
  ...
end loop;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In both cases (unlike Pascal), the loop parameter is local to the loop
(which solves the problem of its value after the loop). It is declared
by the  loop parameter  specification of the for iteration scheme. The
following two forms of loop parameter specification are equivalent:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
COUNTER in 1 .. 10
COUNTER in INTEGER range 1 .. 10
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A null  range -  that is,  a range  whose upper bound is less than its
lower bound  - specifies  zero  iterations.  Within  the  sequence  of
statements of  the loop,  the loop parameter is constant and therefore
protected against accidental attempts at modification.
<p>
More complicated forms of loop constructs such as the so-called Zahn's
construct <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Za  74]</a> and  the related  construct provided in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula</a> were
considered in  this design  but in  the end  rejected. As shown in the
example below,  situations for which such constructs would be used can
be dealt with quite easily with the existing forms.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  type CAUSE is (TOO_LOW, NORMAL, TOO_HIGH);
  STATE :  CAUSE :=  NORMAL;
begin
  for  ...  loop
    ...
    STATE :=  TOO_LOW;  exit;
    ...
    STATE :=  TOO_HIGH; exit;
    ...
    STATE :=  TOO_LOW;  exit;
    ...
  end loop;

  case STATE is
    when TOO_LOW  =&gt; ...
    when TOO_HIGH =&gt; ...
    when NORMAL   =&gt; ...
  end case;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The major  emphasis in  the design  of the  loop statement has been on
simplicity: loops  should have  an intuitive  meaning and users should
not have  to consult  a reference  manual to understand their meaning.
Several studies  on the  use of  programming languages have shown that
the vast majority of loops are very simple. Hence generalities such as
the step  expression of  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 60 </a> should be  avoided. The  redundancy
provided for  conditional exits  is itself  motivated  by  readability
considerations: loop  termination conditions  should  be  marked  very
conspicuously. Thus, in the recommended paragraphing,
<p>
<PRE>    exit when CONDITION;
</PRE><p>
is certainly  more conspicuous  than the  equivalent form in which the
exit statement is nested within an if statement:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
if CONDITION then
  exit;
end if;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Guarded  commands  were  also  considered  for  this  design  and  not
retained. They  have advantages for the development of program proofs.
However, they  are not  compatible with  other looping constructs with
explicit exits.  Hence if they had been retained it would have been to
the exclusion  of other  forms of  loop statement,  a decision
which seemed too drastic.
