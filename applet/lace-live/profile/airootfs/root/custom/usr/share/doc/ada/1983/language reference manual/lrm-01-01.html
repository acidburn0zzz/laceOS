This  standard  specifies  the form and meaning of program units written in
Ada.  Its purpose is to promote  the  portability  of  Ada  programs  to  a
variety of data processing systems.

<P>
This standard specifies: 
<ol>
<li>The form of a program unit written in Ada. 
<li>The effect of translating and executing such a program unit. 
<li>The manner in  which  program  units  may  be  combined  to  form  Ada
programs.
<li>The predefined program units that  a  conforming  implementation  must
supply. 
<li>The permissible variations within the  standard,  and  the  manner  in
which they must be specified.  
<li>Those violations of the standard that a conforming  implementation  is
required  to  detect,  and  the  effect  of attempting to translate or
execute a program unit containing such violations. 
<li>Those violations of the standard that a conforming  implementation  is
not required to detect.                                                   
</ol>
This standard does not specify: 
<ol>
<li>The means whereby a program unit written in Ada  is  transformed  into
object code executable by a processor. 
<li>The means whereby translation or execution of program units is invoked
and the executing units are controlled. 
<li>The size or speed of the object code, or the relative execution  speed
of different language constructs. 
<li>The form or contents of any listings produced by implementations;   in
particular, the form or contents of error or warning messages. 
<li>The effect of executing a program unit  that  contains  any  violation
that a conforming implementation is not required to detect. 
<li>The size of a program or program unit that will exceed the capacity of
a particular conforming implementation. 
</ol>
Where  this  standard  specifies  that a program unit written in Ada has an
exact effect, this effect is the operational meaning of  the  program  unit
and  must  be  produced  by  all  conforming  implementations.   Where this
standard specifies permissible variations in the effects of constituents of  
a program unit written in Ada, the operational meaning of the program  unit
as  a  whole  is understood to be the range of possible effects that result
from all these variations, and a conforming implementation  is  allowed  to
produce  any of these possible effects.  Examples of permissible variations
are: 
<ul>
<li>The represented values of fixed or floating  numeric  quantities,  and
the results of operations upon them. 
<br><br>
<li>The order of execution of statements in different parallel  tasks,  in
the absence of explicit synchronization.   
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="1.1.2">1.1.2</A>.  Conformity of an Implementation With the Standard  </H3>
<A HREF="#1.1.1"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="#1.1"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A>
<P>
A conforming implementation is one that: 
<ol>
<li>Correctly translates and executes legal program units written in  Ada,
provided  that  they are not so large as to exceed the capacity of the
implementation. 
<li>Rejects all program units that are so large as to exceed the  capacity
of the implementation. 
<li>Rejects all program units  that  contain  errors  whose  detection  is
required by the standard. 
<li>Supplies all predefined program units required by the standard.   
<li>Contains no variations except where the standard permits. 
<li>Specifies all such permitted variations in the  manner  prescribed  by
the standard.
