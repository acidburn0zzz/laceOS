<H2>CHAPTER 2: Lexical and Textual Structure</H2>

<H3><a name="2.1">2.1 Lexical Structure</a></H3>

A program is written in characters forming lines on a printed page.
The arrangement on the page is primarily to assist the human reader,
and consequently is mainly in free format. The allowed characters
belong to the ISO (ASCII) character set, and the text of a program may
contain both upper case and lower case letters. For portability
reasons, it is possible to write any program in a 56 character subset
of the ISO character set.
<p>
On a higher level than that of characters, a program is considered to
consist of lexical elements. Both the mechanical compiler and the
human interpreter of programs will tend to work in lexical elements,
so it is important that these elements should be clearly specified.
Lexical elements are clearly delimited and may not straddle line
boundaries - a restriction that assists human reading and helps
compilers to recover after having detected an error.
<p>
The lexical elements are:
<UL>
<li>    Identifiers, including those for reserved words and attribute
designators
<li>    Single-character delimiters and two-character compound delimiters
<li>    Numeric literals: integer literals and real literals
<li>    Character literals and string literals
 
</UL>
Each literal is a lexical element that stands for a value, namely the
value literally represented: for example, 10 and 1E1 are two integer
literals which both stand for the integer value ten. In addition, a
program text can include elements that have no influence on the
meaning of the program but are included as information and guidance
for the human reader or for the compiler. These are:
<UL>
<li>    Comments
<li>    Pragmas
</UL>
Identifiers start with a letter which may be followed by a sequence of
letters and digits. In addition, an underline character may appear
between two other characters of an identifier. This underline is
significant and plays the role of the space in ordinary prose (but
without breaking the integrity of the identifier). The need for such
an underline is seen from good choices of names such as BYTES_PER_WORD
rather than BYTESPERWORD. Furthermore the significance of the
underline makes SPACE_PER_SON a different identifier from SPACEPERSON
or SPACE_PERSON and A_NYLON_GRIP different from ANY_LONG_RIP.
<p>
Reserved words are special identifiers that are reserved for special
significance in the language. There are 63 such words. Many of them
play an important role in the definition of the overall syntax of the
major program units of the language, for example:
<pre>    procedure   is   begin   end
</pre>
Other reserved words play a syntactic role at a more detailed level,
for example:
<pre>    constant   in   out   range
</pre>

Finally, seven of them are used as operators. These are the reserved
words
<pre>    and   or   xor   not   abs   rem   mod
</pre>
<p>
Reserved words other than operators cannot be redeclared, and
operators can only be redeclared as operators and with the same
precedence. Hence programmers cannot write obscure programs by
redefining the meaning of words that play an important syntactic role
in the definition of the structure of Ada texts. Similarly,
declarations written by programmers cannot affect overall properties
of the syntax, for example, the fact that if two adjacent lexical
elements are identifiers, one of them (at least) must be a reserved
word.
<p>
Special printing of reserved words is recommended for highlighting
programs on an appropriate output device. The method chosen in this
book is boldface (and lower case). Since the language does not
distinguish between character fonts, one can envisage methods of
highlighting the reserved words by the use of a different font, such
as lower case, italics, underlining, color, and so on. Clearly, this
does not contradict the use of the ISO character set for program
input. On the other hand, for program printouts, it is currently
possible to get excellent renditions via graphical printers, color
screens, or photocomposers; and it is important to exploit this
ability in order to enhance the readability of programs.
<p>
The identifiers for attribute designators are not treated as reserved
words; they are always preceded by an apostrophe (pronounced prime or
tick) and can thus be distinguished from declared identifiers and
reserved words purely on the basis of lexical information. The
identifiers for predefined attribute designators are in fact different
from the reserved words, excepting only DIGITS, DELTA, and RANGE.
<p>
Ada uses attributes as environment enquiries and to refer to
predefined properties. Other languages have used functional notation
or dot notation for this purpose. These alternative forms both have
the disadvantage of restricting the user's free choice of names. For
example, if the address of an object were denoted by a function, this
function would have to be overloaded on all data types. Furthermore
any user definition of ADDRESS would hide the predefined one and thus
make it unavailable. Similarly, dot notation would prevent declaration
of record components with the same identifier as an attribute
designator. Neither of these consequences is acceptable in light of
the fact that the number of attribute designators can be large, and
that some of them may be specific to an implementation. Both problems
are avoided by the Ada notation for attributes.
<p>
The choice of identifiers for reserved words and attributes depends
primarily on convention. Preference is given to full English words
rather than abbreviations since we believe full words to be simpler to
read. For instance procedure is used rather than proc (in Algol 68)
and constant rather than const (in Pascal). Shorter words are also
given preference: for example access is used in preference to
reference, and task is used in preference to process.
<p>
The following special characters can be used as single-character
delimiters between lexical elements:
<pre>    &amp;  '  ( )  &#42;  +  ,  -  .  /  :  ;  &lt;  =  &gt;  |
</pre>

Two-character compound delimiters are constructed by juxtaposition of
two such characters, as follows:
<pre>    =&gt;  ..  **  :=  /=  &gt;=  &lt;=  &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  &lt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>

Naturally, in listings of Ada programs, the compound delimiters can be
represented following conventional notations where the corresponding
characters exist:
<pre><font size=+1>    /=  as    &ne;      &gt;=  as  &ge;      &lt;=  as  &le;
</font></pre>
<p>
Numeric literals are all introduced by an initial digit. A requirement
that has long been recognized when printing numeric tables is for a
character to break up long sequences of digits: in Ada, the underline
character serves this purpose. In contrast to identifiers, underlines
in numeric literals do not alter the meaning, so that 12_000 naturally
has the same value as 12000.
<p>
A simple sequence of digits is an integer literal written in decimal
notation. For other bases from 2 up to 16, the base is given first and
is followed by a sequence of digits enclosed by sharp characters (#)
or by colons (:), the colon being used as replacement character for
the sharp, but only when the sharp is not available. The enclosed
digits may include the letters A to F for bases greater than ten.
Thus, the conventional ways of expressing bit patterns in binary,
octal, or hexadecimal are provided.
<p>
Real literals must contain a period, which represents the radix point.
They may be expressed in decimal notation or with other bases.
Finally, both integer and real literals may include the letter E
followed by an exponent.
<p>
Examples of numeric literals are given below:

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>10                        -- an integer literal
 
10.0                      -- a real literal
 
1E3                       -- an integer literal of value 1000
 
1.5E2                     -- a real literal of value 150.0
 
2#1111_1111#              -- an integer literal of value 255
 
2#1#E8                    -- an integer literal of value 256
 
2#1.1111_1111_111#E11     -- a real literal of value 4095.0</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Other forms of lexical element are character literals and string
literals. A character literal is formed by enclosing a single
character between two apostrophes (') - its value belongs to a
character type. A string literal is formed by enclosing zero or more
characters between double quotes (") - the value of a string literal
is a sequence of character values.
<p>
String literals (like all lexical elements) are limited to a single
line: otherwise for sequences straddling line boundaries the number of
spaces in the string would not be clear since the end of line is not
visibly delimited. Furthermore, the limitation to one line reduces the
consequences of compilation errors arising from the (unintentional)
omission of a closing quote character.
<p>
To represent a long sequence of characters, the sequence is split into
several string literals, each on a single line, and connected by the
catenation operator (&amp;). Apart from long sequences, there may be a
need to split sequences that contain characters that are not in the 56
basic character subset of ASCII. Examples of catenations of string
literals are as follows:

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>"A long line of printed output which " &amp;
 
"is continued on the next line of the
     program."
 
"END OF LINE " &amp; ASCII.CR &amp; ASCII.LF &amp;
     "START OF NEXT LINE"</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Comments may appear alone on a line or at the end of a line. As an end
of line remark, the comment should appear as an explanation of the
preceding text -- hence the use of a double hyphen (doing duty for a
dash) is natural and appropriate, as illustrated by this sentence. For
simplicity, a space is not allowed between the two hyphens. No form of
embedded comments (within a line of text) is provided, as their
utility is insufficient to justify the extra complexity. Single
comments that are larger than one line are not provided. Such comments
would require a closing comment delimiter and this would again raise
the dangers associated with the (unintentional) omission of the
closing delimiter: entire sections of a program could be ignored by
the compiler without the programmer realizing it, so that the program
would not mean what he thinks. Long comments can be written as a
succession of single line comments, thus combining elegance with
safety.
<p>
A pragma (from the Greek word meaning action) is used to direct the
actions of the compiler in particular ways, but has no effect on the
semantics of a program (in general). Pragmas are used to control
listing, to define an object configuration (for example, the size of
memory), to control features of the code generated (for example, the
degree of optimization or the level of diagnostics), and so on. Such
directives are not likely to be related to the rest of the language in
an obvious way. Hence the form taken should not intrude upon the
language, but it should be uniform. Thus, the general form of pragmas
is defined by the language. They start with the reserved word pragma
followed by a pragma identifier, optionally followed by a list of
arguments enclosed by parentheses, and terminated by a semicolon. The
overall syntax of the pragma identifier and arguments is similar to
that of a procedure call. Pragmas are allowed at places where a
declaration or a statement is allowed; also at places where other
constructs that play the role of declarations (for example clauses)
are allowed. Examples of pragmas are as follows:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>pragma LIST(ON);        -- listing wanted

pragma INLINE(SET_MASK);   -- in line inclusion of call
 
pragma OPTIMIZE(SPACE);
 
pragma SUPPRESS(RANGE_CHECK,  ON =&gt;  TABLE);</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Some pragmas are defined by the language (see <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-B.html#B">Annex B of the reference
manual</a>). It is expected that other pragmas will be defined by various
implementations, in particular for the programming support
environments developed around the Ada language.
