This annex defines the pragmas LIST, PAGE, and OPTIMIZE, and summarizes the
definitions given elsewhere of the remaining language-defined pragmas. 
<ul>
<li>Pragma<br>
Meaning 
<li> CONTROLLED<br>     
Takes the simple name  of  an  access  type  as  the  single
argument.   This  pragma  is only allowed immediately within
the declarative part or package specification that  contains
the  declaration  of  the access type;  the declaration must
occur before the pragma.  This pragma is not allowed  for  a
derived  type.  This pragma specifies that automatic storage
reclamation must not be performed for objects designated  by
values of the access type, except upon leaving the innermost
block statement, subprogram body, or task body that encloses
the  access  type  declaration,  or  after  leaving the main
program (see <a href="lrm-04-08.html#4.8">4.8</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> ELABORATE<br>      
Takes one or more simple names  denoting  library  units  as
arguments.   This  pragma  is only allowed immediately after
the  context  clause  of  a  compilation  unit  (before  the
subsequent  library  unit or secondary unit).  Each argument
must be the simple name of a library unit mentioned  by  the
context    clause.    This   pragma   specifies   that   the
corresponding library unit body must  be  elaborated  before
the  given  compilation unit.  If the given compilation unit
is a subunit, the  library  unit  body  must  be  elaborated
before  the body of the ancestor library unit of the subunit
(see <a href="lrm-10-05.html#10.5">10.5</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> INLINE<br>         
Takes one or more names as arguments;  each name  is  either
the   name  of  a  subprogram  or  the  name  of  a  generic
subprogram.  This pragma is only allowed at the place  of  a
declarative   item   in   a   declarative  part  or  package
specification, or after a library unit in a compilation, but
before  any  subsequent  compilation  unit.    This   pragma
specifies  that  the  subprogram  bodies  should be expanded
inline at each call  whenever possible;  in the  case  of  a
generic  subprogram,  the  pragma  applies  to  calls of its
instantiations (see <a href="lrm-06-03.html#6.3.2">6.3.2</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> INTERFACE<br>      
Takes a language name and a subprogram  name  as  arguments.
This  pragma  is allowed at the place of a declarative item,
and must apply in this case to a subprogram declared  by  an
earlier  declarative  item  of  the same declarative part or
package specification.  This pragma is also  allowed  for  a
library unit;  in this case the pragma must appear after the  
subprogram    declaration,   and   before   any   subsequent
compilation unit.  This pragma specifies the other  language
(and  thereby  the  calling  conventions)  and  informs  the
compiler that an object module  will  be  supplied  for  the
corresponding subprogram (see <a href="lrm-13-09.html#13.9">13.9</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> LIST<br>           
Takes one of  the  identifiers  ON  or  OFF  as  the  single
argument.   This  pragma  is  allowed  anywhere  a pragma is
allowed.  It specifies that listing of the compilation is to
be continued or suspended  until  a  LIST  pragma  with  the  
opposite argument is given within the same compilation.  The
pragma  itself is always listed if the compiler is producing
a listing. 
<br><br>
<li> MEMORY_SIZE<br>    
Takes a numeric literal as the single argument.  This pragma
is only allowed at the start of a  compilation,  before  the
first  compilation  unit  (if  any) of the compilation.  The
effect of this pragma is to use the value of  the  specified
numeric  literal  for  the  definition  of  the named number
MEMORY_SIZE (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7">13.7</a>).                                     
<br><br>
<li> OPTIMIZE<br>       
Takes one of the identifiers TIME or  SPACE  as  the  single
argument.   This pragma is only allowed within a declarative
part and it applies to  the  block  or  body  enclosing  the
declarative part.  It specifies whether time or space is the
primary optimization criterion. 
<br><br>
<li> PACK<br>           
Takes the simple name of a  record  or  array  type  as  the
single  argument. The allowed positions for this pragma, and
the restrictions on the named type, are governed by the same
rules as for a representation clause. The  pragma  specifies
that  storage minimization should be the main criterion when
selecting the representation of the given type  (see  <a href="lrm-13-01.html#13.1">13.1</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> PAGE<br>       
This pragma has no  argument,  and  is  allowed  anywhere  a
pragma is allowed.  It specifies that the program text which
follows  the  pragma  should  start  on  a  new page (if the
compiler is currently producing a listing).  
<br><br>
<li> PRIORITY<br>       
Takes a static expression of the predefined integer  subtype
PRIORITY  as  the  single  argument.   This  pragma  is only
allowed  within  the  specification  of  a  task   unit   or
immediately  within the outermost declarative part of a main
program.  It specifies the priority of the task (or tasks of
the task type) or the priority  of  the  main  program  (see
<a href="lrm-09-08.html#9.8">9.8</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> SHARED<br>         
Takes the simple name of a variable as the single  argument.
This  pragma  is  allowed only for a variable declared by an
object declaration and whose type  is  a  scalar  or  access
type;   the  variable  declaration  and the pragma must both
occur  (in  this  order)   immediately   within   the   same
declarative  part  or  package  specification.   This pragma
specifies that every read or update of  the  variable  is  a
synchronization  point for that variable.  An implementation
must restrict the objects for which this pragma  is  allowed
to  objects  for  which  each  of  direct reading and direct
updating is implemented as  an  indivisible  operation  (see
<a href="lrm-09-11.html#9.11">9.11</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> STORAGE_UNIT<br>   
Takes a numeric literal as the single argument.  This pragma
is  only  allowed  at the start of a compilation, before the
first compilation unit (if any)  of  the  compilation.   The
effect  of  this pragma is to use the value of the specified
numeric literal for  the  definition  of  the  named  number
STORAGE_UNIT (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7">13.7</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> SUPPRESS<br>       
Takes as arguments the identifier of a check and  optionally
also  the  name  of  either  an object, a type or subtype, a
subprogram, a task unit, or a generic unit.  This pragma  is
only allowed either immediately within a declarative part or
immediately  within  a package specification.  In the latter
case, the only allowed form is with a name that  denotes  an
entity   (or   several   overloaded   subprograms)  declared
immediately   within   the   package   specification.    The
permission to omit the given check extends from the place of  
the  pragma  to the end of the declarative region associated
with the innermost  enclosing  block  statement  or  program
unit.   For  a  pragma given in a package specification, the
permission extends to the end of  the  scope  of  the  named
entity. 
<br><br>
If  the  pragma  includes a name, the permission to omit the
given check is further restricted:  it  is  given  only  for
operations on the named object or on all objects of the base
type  of  a  named  type  or  subtype;  for calls of a named
subprogram;  for activations of  tasks  of  the  named  task
type;   or for instantiations of the given generic unit (see
<a href="lrm-11-07.html#11.7">11.7</a>). 
<br><br>
<li> SYSTEM_NAME<br>    
Takes an enumeration literal as the  single  argument.  This
pragma is only allowed at the start of a compilation, before
the first compilation unit (if any) of the compilation.  The
effect of this pragma is to use the enumeration literal with
the  specified identifier for the definition of the constant
SYSTEM_NAME.  This pragma is only allowed if  the  specified
identifier  corresponds  to  one of the literals of the type 
NAME declared in the package SYSTEM (see <a href="lrm-13-07.html#13.7">13.7</a>).                                   
</ul>
