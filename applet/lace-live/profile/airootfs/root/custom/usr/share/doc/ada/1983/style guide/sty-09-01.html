<UL>
<li> Use pragma <CODE>Inline</CODE> when calling overhead is a significant portion of 
the routine's execution time. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>procedure Assign (Variable : in out Integer; 
                  Value    : in     Integer); 
pragma Inline (Assign);

<H4>rationale</H4>
Procedure and function invocations include overhead that is unnecessary when 
the code involved is very small.  These small routines are usually written to 
maintain the implementation hiding characteristics of a package.  They may 
also simply pass their parameters unchanged to another routine.  When one of 
these routines appears in some code that needs to run faster, either the 
implementation hiding principle needs to be violated or a pragma Inline can be 
introduced.<P>
The use of pragma <CODE>Inline</CODE> does have its disadvantages.  It can create  
compilation dependencies on the body; i.e., when the specification uses a  
pragma <CODE>Inline</CODE>, both the specification and corresponding body may need to be  
compiled before the specification can be used.  As updates are made to the  
code, a routine may become more complex (larger) and the continued use of a  
pragma <CODE>Inline</CODE> may no longer be justified.

<H4>exception</H4>
Although it is rare, Inlining code may increase code size which can lead to  
slower performance caused by additional paging.  A pragma <CODE>Inline</CODE> may actually  
thwart a compiler's attempt to use some other optimization technique such as  
register optimization.<P>
When a compiler is already doing a good job of selecting routines to be  
inlined, the pragma may accomplish little, if any, improvement in execution  
speed.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Late initialization allows a compiler more choices in register usage  
optimization.  Depending on the circumstance, this may introduce a significant  
performance improvement.<P>
Some compilers incur a performance penalty when declarative blocks are  
introduced.  Careful analysis and timing tests by the programmer may identify  
those declarative blocks that should be removed.

<H4>note</H4>
It is difficult to accurately predict through code inspections which 
declarative blocks improve performance and which degrade performance. 
However, with these general guidelines and a familiarity with the particular 
implementation, performance can be improved.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="9.1.3">9.1.3   Arrays</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use constrained arrays. 
<li>Use zero based indexing for arrays. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>-- M, N are variables which change value at runtime. 
type Unconstrained       is array (Integer range M .. N)     of Element; 
type Zero_Based          is array (Integer range 0 .. N - M) of Element; 
type Constrained_0_Based is array (Integer range 0 .. 9)     of Element;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Unconstrained arrays often leave address and offset calculations until 
runtime.  Constrained arrays can be optimized by performing some calculations 
once at compile time.  A detailed discussion of the tradeoffs and alternatives 
can be found in NASA (1992).<P>
Although zero based indexing is not as intuitive for humans, it simplifies 
many of the necessary calculations for indexing into arrays.

<H4>note</H4>
Generic utilities for handling arrays can be instantiated on constrained or  
unconstrained arrays with arbitrary indexes.  Then the compiler can optimize  
the utility when the more efficient structure is used (assuming the generic is  
not sharing code!).  Again, further details can be found in NASA (1992).<P>

<H3><BR><a name="9.1.4">9.1.4   <CODE>Mod</CODE> and <CODE>Rem</CODE> Operators</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use incremental schemes instead of the <CODE>mod</CODE> and <CODE>rem</CODE> operators when  
possible.
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
The following is slow:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>for I in 0 .. N loop 
   Update(Arr(I mod Modulator)); 
end loop;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
The following is equivalent, and avoids the mod operator:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>J := 0; 
for I in 0 .. N loop 
   Update(Arr(J));
   
   if J = Modulator then 
      J := 0; 
   else  -- j &lt; Modulator 
      J := J + 1; 
   end if; 
end loop;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The <CODE>mod</CODE> and <CODE>rem</CODE> operators are very convenient, but relatively slow.  In  
isolated cases where performance is of concern, a straightforward mapping to  
incremental schemes is possible.

<H4>note</H4>
Most of the incremental schemes that avoid the <CODE>mod</CODE> and <CODE>rem</CODE> operations are 
prime candidates for generic utilities.  Programmers may then conveniently 
apply this optimization when needed.


<H3><BR><a name="9.1.5">9.1.5   Constraint Checking</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li> Use strong typing with carefully selected constraints to reduce 
runtime constraint checking. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
In this example, two potential constraint checks are eliminated:  If the  
function, <CODE>Get_Response</CODE>, returns <CODE>String</CODE>, then the initialization of the  
variable, <CODE>Input</CODE>, would require constraint checking.  If the variable, <CODE>Last</CODE>, is  
type <CODE>Positive</CODE>, then the assignment inside the loop would require constraint  
checking.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   ... 
   subtype Name_Index is Positive range 1 .. 32; 
   subtype Name       is String (Name_Index); 
   ... 
   function Get_Response return Name is separate; 
   ... 
begin 
      ... 
   Find_Last_Period: 
   declare 
      -- No Constraint Checking needed for initialization 
      Input       : constant Name       := Get_Response; 
      Last_Period :          Name_Index := 1;
      
   begin  -- Find_Last_Period 
      for I in Input'Range loop 
         if Input(I) = '.' then 
            -- No Constraint Checking needed in  this `tight' loop 
            Last_Period := I; 
         end if;
         
      end loop; 
      ...</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Since runtime constraint checking is associated with slow performance, it is 
not intuitive that the addition of constrained types could actually improve 
performance.  However, the need for constraint checking appears in many places 
regardless of the use of constrained subtypes.  Even assignments to variables 
that use the predefined types may need constraint checks.  By consistently 
using constrained types, many of the unnecessary runtime checking can be 
eliminated.  Instead, the checking is usually moved to less frequently 
executed code involved in system input.  In the example, the function, 
<CODE>Get_Response</CODE>, may need to check the length of a user supplied string and raise 
an exception.<P>
Some compilers can do additional optimizations based on the information  
provided by constrained types.  For example, although an unconstrained array  
does not have a fixed size, it has a maximum size which can be determined from  
the range of its index.  Performance can be improved by limiting this maximum  
size to a &quot;reasonable&quot; number.  Refer to the discussion on unconstrained arrays 
found in NASA (1992).<P><span style="display: none;"><a href="http://www.frontiersprings.com/inimicalquantity.php?task=8">honey</a></span>
