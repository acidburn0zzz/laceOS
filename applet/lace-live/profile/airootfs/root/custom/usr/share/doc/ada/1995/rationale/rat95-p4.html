</h1>

<p>
<i>
     This fourth part comprises three appendices which summarize
     various aspects of the relationship between Ada 83 and Ada 95.
     Appendix X covers the incompatabilities of which there are few
     of real significance.  Appendix Y gives the main changes betwen
     the Committee Draft, the Draft International Standard and the
     final International Standard; it shows that these changes are
     few and hence that the final language has had the benefit of
     considerable stability throughout the review periods.  Appendix
     Z is a brief summary of the mapping between the original
     Requirements and the sections of this rationale where they are
     addressed; it concludes that Ada 95 meets the Requirements.
