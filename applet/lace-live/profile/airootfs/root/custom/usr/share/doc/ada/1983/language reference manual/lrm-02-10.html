<H2><A NAME="2.10">2.10</A>.  Allowable Replacements of Characters  </H2>
<A HREF="lrm-02-09.html#2.9"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="lrm-02.html#2"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A>>
<P>
The  following  replacements  are  allowed for the vertical bar, sharp, and
quotation basic characters: 
<ul>
<li>A vertical bar character (|) can be replaced by  an  exclamation  mark
(!)  where used as a delimiter.<br><br> 
<li>The sharp characters (#) of a based literal can be replaced by  colons
(:) provided that the replacement is done for both occurrences.<br><br> 
<li>The quotation characters (") used as string brackets at both ends of a
string literal can be replaced by percent characters (%) provided that  
the  enclosed  sequence of characters contains no quotation character,
and provided that both string  brackets  are  replaced.   Any  percent
character  within  the sequence of characters must then be doubled and
each such doubled percent character is interpreted as a single percent
character value.                                                    
</ul>
<P>
These replacements do not change the meaning of the program. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
It is recommended that use of the replacements for the vertical bar, sharp,
and quotation characters be restricted to  cases  where  the  corresponding
graphical symbols are not available.  Note that the vertical bar appears as
a  broken  bar  on  some equipment;  replacement is not recommended in this
case.  
<P>
The rules given for identifiers and numeric literals are  such  that  lower
case  and  upper  case  letters  can  be used indifferently;  these lexical
elements can thus be written using only characters of the  basic  character
set.  If a string literal of the predefined type STRING contains characters
that  are  not  in  the basic character set, the same sequence of character
values can be obtained by catenating  string  literals  that  contain  only
characters  of  the  basic  character set with suitable character constants
declared in the predefined package ASCII.  Thus the string literal  "AB$CD"
could  be  replaced  by  "AB" &amp; ASCII.DOLLAR &amp; "CD".  Similarly, the string
literal "ABcd" with  lower  case  letters  could  be  replaced  by  "AB"  &amp;
ASCII.LC_C &amp; ASCII.LC_D.
