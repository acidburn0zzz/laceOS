<H2>CHAPTER 5: Numeric Types</H2>

<H3><a name="5.1">5.1 Introduction</a></H3>

The importance of numerical calculations in the use of computers dates
from their  earliest days.  The floating  point hardware of the second
generation  of  machines  resulted  from  the  need  to  perform  fast
calculations with  approximate representations  of numerical data that
varied over  a wide  range of  values. However,  in spite of this long
history of numerical computation, the handling of both fixed point and
floating point  data  types  is  unsatisfactory  in  most  programming
languages.
<p>
<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a> is  widely used  for scientific  computation and compilers are
available on  almost all machines. Several large packages of numerical
routines of  a high  professional standard,  such as  the  library  of
subroutines  of  the  Numerical  Algorithms  Group  (NAG),  have  been
implemented  in  Fortran  and  made  available  on  a  wide  range  of
computers. Nevertheless,  numerous defects can easily trap the unwary.
For example,  when a  floating point  value is  assigned to an integer
variable the  value is  truncated; this  obvious trap is compounded by
the lack  of any definition of this effect - the standard does not say
whether -3.8  truncates to  -3 or  to -4, that is, whether the sign is
considered after  truncation or  with it. Moreover Fortran provides no
facilities for fixed point arithmetic, for which there is a particular
need on computers without floating point hardware.

<p>

The most  difficult area  is the  control of floating point precision,
for which no entirely adequate solution is available. <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a> does not
define the  accuracy of  single precision  values.  Consequently,  the
number of  bits in  the mantissa of a single precision value can be 48
on one  system and 24 on another; to achieve a given precision, say 30
bits, one  would have  to specify single precision on the first system
but double precision on the second.
<p>
To change the precision for a Fortran 66 program is extremely awkward,
and requires  a careful  review of  the program text: the exponents of
floating point  literals must be changed, all intrinsic functions must
be altered,  and so  on; some  functions such  as FLOAT have no double
length counterpart. The Numerical Algorithms Group overcame this by an
elaborate text  processing  package  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[HF  76]</a>.  By  adopting  suitable
programming conventions, most of the changes can be made with a simple
text edit, but there is no simple complete solution. For instance, use
of double  length throughout is not effective because of its excessive
cost, changing  the type  by IMPLICIT  is not standard Fortran, and in
any case IMPLICIT cannot be used for literals.
<p>
Changing precision  is much  easier for  a Fortran 77 program, because
many of  the problems  identified above  have  been  eliminated.  Some
problems remain, however: thus it is still not possible to specify the
precision of  a type  explicitly - say in decimal digits. Moreover the
change from  single to  double precision  is sometimes  difficult: for
instance single  length COMPLEX  is a  defined data  type  but  DOUBLE
COMPLEX is  not. It should be noted that the proposed standard Fortran
8X attempts  to overcome  all of  these problems,  and others,  and in
consequence has features similar to those of Ada.
<p>
Several languages  in the <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 60</a> tradition, such as Pascal, Coral 66
and RTL/2, admit only one floating point data type. In some cases this
simple solution  meets the  users' requirements  better  than  Fortran
does. The  two Algol  60 compilers for the IBM 360 provide a directive
to specify  32 or  64 bit  precision -  substantially easier to change
than the  corresponding precision  in Fortran.  In essence, unless the
declarations can determine different precisions, it is best to use the
same precision  for all  floating point  quantities, and  therefore to
have only one floating-point data type in the language.
<p>
Control of precision in Algol 68 is by declaration of types real, long
real, or  even long  long real.  Although the  precision  of  real  is
implementation-dependent, so that declarative changes to a program may
still be needed in order to maintain the required accuracy when moving
it from one implementation to another, these changes are rather easy.
<p>
Any  language   that  has  user-defined  types,  and  some  method  of
controlling precision,  has the  essential mechanism  for an effective
solution of  this problem.  It is,  of  course,  imperative  that  the
programmer use  the typing  facility in  such a  way that the floating
point declarations  can easily  be remapped when a change of precision
is needed.

<h3><BR><a name="5.1.2">5.1.2 Fixed Point: The Problems</a></h3>

There is  also considerable  difficulty in  formulating a satisfactory
fixed point facility. The Steelman requirements <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[DoD 78]</a> specify exact
fixed point computation:
<blockquote>
   ... fixed  point numbers  shall be  treated  as  exact  numeric
   values.  ...   The  scale  or  step  size  (i.e.,  the  minimal
   representable difference  between values)  of each  fixed point
   variable must  be ...  determinable during  translation. Scales
   shall not be restricted to powers of two.
</blockquote>

Thus the  possible values  of a  fixed point variable must be integral
multiples of  a fixed  quantity called  the scale.  Exact addition and
subtraction do not cause problems, but multiplication and division do.
<p>
To illustrate these problems, let us consider the case of calculations
on electrical  insulation, using  Ohm's  Law:  current  multiplied  by
resistance equals voltage. Suppose that we measure the leakage current
to an  accuracy of one milliampere, and adopt this as the step size or
scale of  a variable  LEAKAGE. This  means that  only whole numbers of
milliamperes can  be represented:  the value of LEAKAGE will always be
an integer  L times the scale of 0.001 amperes. In like fashion we may
measure the  resistance of the insulation to an accuracy of 1000 ohms,
and use  a variable RESISTANCE whose value will always be an integer R
times the scale of 1000 ohms, that is, R kilo-ohms.
<p>
Now the  potential  supported  by  the  insulation  is  the  value  of
LEAKAGE&#42;RESISTANCE, and  because the scale factors happen to cancel it
will be  LR volts.  This is  again an  integer, but  we cannot  simply
assign it  to a  third fixed  point variable  POTENTIAL  having  scale
factor one  volt, and  treat this  variable in  the same  way  as  the
others, because  only a subset of the possible values of POTENTIAL can
arise in  this way.  Thus a  given value of POTENTIAL, say P volts (an
integer) cannot be divided by a given value of RESISTANCE, say R kilo-
ohms, to get L milliamperes exactly (which must be an integer) because
P/R will  usually not  be an  integer.  In  addition  there  are  size
problems because  single length  factors give a double length product.
The Ironman requirements <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[DoD 77]</a> recognized this, and required built-
in operations  for integer  and fixed  point division  with remainder.
This would  allow a double length representation of P to be divided by
R to  yield an  integer quotient  L1 and  integer remainder  L2,  each
single length:
<PRE>    P = R&#42;L1 + L2</PRE>
<p>
and it  would be in the hands of the programmer to ignore or use L2 as
he wished.  The operation  would be exact, and L1 could be assigned to
LEAKAGE for further use, as a quantity whose inaccuracy was known.
<p>
<a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Cobol</a> apparently  meets the  Ironman requirements,  but only  by using
decimal scales, which are not adequate for two reasons. First, this is
not necessarily the scaling required by the application, and secondly,
10 is  too coarse  for the standard 16-bit minicomputer. A glance at a
Cobol manual  will also  indicate that explaining the implicit decimal
point to the programmer is not easy.
<p>
In view  of the  difficulty of providing exact fixed point computation
to meet  the Steelman  requirements, we  considered  what  was  really
needed by  the users. An analysis of actual applications in many real-
time situations  revealed that  there was a need for cheap approximate
computation. Small  but frequently executed computations are performed
upon digital input signals. Simple machines do not have floating point
hardware, and  emulation of  floating point  operations by software or
firmware is  not fast  enough, hence  some other  means is required to
perform approximate computations rapidly on such machines. To say that
in the future floating point hardware will always be available may not
be the answer: source data input is inevitably captured in fixed point
representation, and floating point representation requires more space.
Hence approximate fixed point is better matched than floating point to
the needs of common applications.
<p>
It must  be admitted  that, as  we shall  see, programming  with fixed
point is  much more  difficult than  with floating point. On the other
hand, fixed  point is  potentially  more  reliable  because  effective
numerical error  analysis requires tight bounds to be placed upon data
values.
<p>
It is  concluded that  approximate fixed  point is  generally the most
useful arithmetic  capability to  provide that will complement integer
and floating  point facilities. However, Ada fixed point also provides
some exact  operations such as addition and subtraction, and these are
invaluable, for example for the manipulation of intervals of time.

<H3><BR><a name="5.1.3">5.1.3 Overview of Numerics in Ada</a></H3>

The facility  for numerics  is based  upon the  idea  that  a  numeric
variable has  an abstract  value. The  set of values of a numeric type
will be a subset of the set of real numbers. Computation with integers
is  exact.   Computation  with  fixed  point  and  floating  point  is
approximate: the  former with  an absolute  bound on  the  error,  the
latter with  a relative  bound. These approximate types are called the
real types  since they  can be  thought of  as approximations  to  the
mathematical concept of the real numbers.
<p>
The semantics  of each  numeric operation is determined by the type of
its operands. The facility for numerics is based upon three types that
cannot be  named in a program (and hence are said to be anonymous - no
variable of  such a type can be declared). These types are referred to
as  universal_integer,   universal_real,  and   universal_fixed.   Any
specific type in a given implementation is a partial representation of
a universal type.
<DL>
<DT><b>(1) universal_integer</b>
<DD>The type  universal_integer is  an integer  type with a range large
   enough  to   encompass  every   conceivable  integer  type  of  the
   implementation. Integer literals are of type universal_integer.

<DT><b>(2) universal_real</b>
<DD>The type  universal_real is  a real  type with  a precision that is
   high enough  to encompass  any implemented real type. Real literals
   are of type universal_real.

<DT><b>(3) universal_fixed</b>
<DD>The type  universal_fixed is  introduced as  the result type of the
   unscaled fixed  point operations  of multiplication and division to
   be detailed  later. It  is  essentially  a  type  for  intermediate
   results. The  universal_fixed type  has  a  finer  delta  than  any
   implemented fixed point type.
</DL>
The mapping of these universal types onto the implementation-dependent
types is described below.
<DL>
<DT><b>(1) Integer types</b>
<DD>There is  an implementation-dependent  type INTEGER, defined in the
   package STANDARD. The range of type INTEGER reflects the properties
   of the  underlying hardware,  in that  the most efficiently handled
   integer size is used, with a range symmetric about zero (apart from
   possibly one  negative value - see <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-03-05.html#3.5.4">RM 3.5.4</a>(7)). It would have been
   possible to  have designed  a language  that had no predefined type
   such as  INTEGER, but this would have meant that in order to obtain
   a type  that would  give as  large a  range of  int&Acirc;ger  values  as
   possible without  losing efficiency,  the programmer would &Euml;ave had
   to use language facilities that were highly system dependent. So to
   avoid this  dependence, it  is desirable  to have a predefined type
   that maps onto the integer type that is most efficiently handled by
   the target computer.<br><br>

   Additionally, an  implementation may provide types LONG_INTEGER and
   SHORT_INTEGER with larger and smaller ranges than INTEGER. The user
   can define  an integer  type by  stating the  required range;  this
   defines a  subtype of  a type  derived from one of these predefined
   types  -  the  predefined  type  being  suitably  selected  by  the
   implementation. The  most positive and most negative integer values
   that are  supported by  an implementation  are  SYSTEM.MAX_INT  and
   SYSTEM.MIN_INT respectively.<br><br>

<DT><b>(2) Floating point types</b>
<DD>The implementation-defined  types FLOAT, LONG_FLOAT (and so on) can
   be thought  of as  copies  of  the  type  universal_real  but  with
   restricted relative  accuracy. These  types are predefined so as to
   approximate closely  to the  intrinsic floating-point  types of the
   target computer.  The user may define other floating point types in
   terms of  these machine  types, or  simply by  stating the required
   precision; in  the latter  case this  defines a  subtype of  a type
   derived from  one of  the predefined  types -  the predefined  type
   being suitably selected by the implementation.<br><br>

   A  hardware  floating  point  representation  has  two  independent
   parameters -  the length  of the  mantissa and  the  range  of  the
   exponent. The  mantissa length  defines the  relative accuracy, and
   the exponent  range defines the range of the floating point values.
   In Ada,  the user defines a floating point type by stating only the
   required precision, as a number of decimal digits; this defines the
   mantissa length.  The language requires each floating point type to
   have an exponent range that is workable in relation to its mantissa
   length. In  this way  the two parameters are reduced to one, with a
   gain in simplicity for the user.<br><br>

<DT><b>(3) Fixed point types</b>
<DD>In contrast  to floating  point, a fixed point type has an absolute
   rather than  a relative accuracy. This absolute bound on the errors
   is called the delta. The user can define other fixed point types by
   specifying  the   required  delta,   together  with  the  range  of
   magnitudes to be encompassed.
</DL>

<H4>Constants</H4>

One finds  in many  programs several  constants that  parameterize the
particular application.  These constants  have no particular type, but
may be  related one  to another;  for example  the middle of a line is
related to the line length. Number declarations are provided in Ada to
express this.  They allow  the calculation  of specific  values having
fixed relationships. For example:

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
LINE_LENGTH          :  constant :=  80;
MID_LINE             :  constant :=  LINE_LENGTH/2;
PI                   :  constant :=  3.14159_26536;
RADIANS_PER_DEGREE   :  constant :=  PI/180;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Without this  facility, a  change to  the program to modify a constant
would involve  a search for all occurrences of the constant as well as
of related  constants. This  would be  both  tedious  and  risky:  for
example the constant 40 might or might not be intended to signify half
the line  length, and  even with  a corresponding  comment the process
would be error prone.
<p>
The type  of such  a named number depends on the primaries used in the
expression on  the right;  if these yield real values, the type of the
constant is  universal_real, if they yield integer values, the type is
universal_integer;  a   mixture  of  real  and  integer  values  gives
universal_real.  Thus  the  first  two  examples  above  are  of  type
universal_integer and the second two are of type universal_real.
<p>
A numeric literal is either an integer literal or a real literal. Thus
80 and  2 above  are integer  literals because they contain no decimal
point, while  3.14159_26536 is a real literal. Within an expression, a
numeric literal  will be  implicitly converted  to the  required  type
determined by  the context - an integer literal to an integer type and
a real  literal to  a real  type. For  example, implicit conversion is
performed in these cases:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
J  :  INTEGER :=  2;
P  :  INTEGER :=  4&#42;J;
A  :  REAL :=  REAL(P) - 0.23;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In the  second case, because J is of type INTEGER, the integer literal
4  is   implicitly  converted   to  INTEGER   as  an  operand  of  the
multiplication, which  yields a  product of  type INTEGER. In the last
case, the  subtraction must deliver a REAL result, so P needs explicit
conversion to  the type  REAL, but conversion of the real literal 0.23
to REAL  is implicit.  It should be noted that no accuracy can be lost
by such  implicit  conversion  of  numeric  literals  -  the  accuracy
required by the target type is always provided.
