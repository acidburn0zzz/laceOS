<P>
A  use clause achieves direct visibility of declarations that appear in the
visible parts of named packages. 
<pre>
    use_clause ::= use package_name {, package_name}; 
</pre>
<P>
For each use clause, there is a certain region of text called the scope  of
the use clause.  This region starts immediately after the use clause.  If a
use  clause  is a declarative item of some declarative region, the scope of
the clause extends to the end of the declarative region.  If a  use  clause
occurs  within a context clause of a compilation unit, the scope of the use
clause extends to the end of the declarative  region  associated  with  the
compilation unit. 
<P>
In  order to define which declarations are made directly visible at a given
place by use clauses, consider the set of packages named by all use clauses
whose scopes enclose this place, omitting from this set any  packages  that
enclose  this  place.  A declaration that can be made directly visible by a
use clause (a potentially visible  declaration)  is  any  declaration  that 
occurs  immediately  within  the  visible  part of a package of the set.  A
potentially visible declaration is actually made directly visible except in
the following two cases: 
<ul>
<li>A potentially visible declaration is not made directly visible if  the
place  considered  is within the immediate scope of a homograph of the  
declaration.<br><br> 
<li>Potentially visible declarations that have the same identifier are not
made directly visible unless each of them  is  either  an  enumeration
literal  specification  or  the  declaration  of  a  subprogram  (by a
subprogram   declaration,   a   renaming   declaration,   a    generic
instantiation, or an implicit declaration). 
</ul>
<P>
The elaboration of a use clause has no other effect.
<P>
Note: 
<P>
The  above rules guarantee that a declaration that is made directly visible
by a use clause cannot hide an otherwise directly visible declaration.  The
above rules are formulated in terms of the set of packages  named  by  use
clauses.                                         
<P>
Consequently,  the  following  lines  of  text  all  have  the  same effect
(assuming only one package P). 
<pre>
    use P;
    use P; use P, P; 
</pre>
<P>
Example of conflicting names in two packages: 
<pre>
    procedure R is
       package TRAFFIC is
          type COLOR is (RED, AMBER, GREEN);
          ...
       end TRAFFIC; 

       package WATER_COLORS is                    
          type COLOR is (WHITE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, BROWN, BLACK);
          ...
       end WATER_COLORS; 

     use TRAFFIC;       --  COLOR, RED, AMBER, and GREEN are directly visible
     use WATER_COLORS;  --  two homographs of GREEN are directly visible
                        --  but COLOR is no longer directly visible

     subtype LIGHT is TRAFFIC.COLOR;      -- Subtypes are used to resolve
     subtype SHADE is WATER_COLORS.COLOR; -- the conflicting type name COLOR

       SIGNAL : LIGHT;
       PAINT  : SHADE;
    begin
       SIGNAL := GREEN;  --  that of TRAFFIC
       PAINT  := GREEN;  --  that of WATER_COLORS
    end R; 
</pre>
<P>
Example of name identification with a use clause: 
<pre>
       package D is
          T, U, V : BOOLEAN;
       end D; 

       procedure P is
          package E is
             B, W, V : INTEGER;
          end E; 

          procedure Q is
             T, X : REAL;
             use D, E;
          begin
             --  the name T means Q.T, not D.T
             --  the name U means D.U
             --  the name B means E.B
             --  the name W means E.W
             --  the name X means Q.X
             --  the name V is illegal : either D.V or E.V must be used
             ...  
          end Q;
       begin
          ...
       end P;                                                                       
</pre>
