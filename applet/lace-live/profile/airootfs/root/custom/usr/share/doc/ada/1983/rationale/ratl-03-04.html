<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.4">3.4 Names</a></H3>

A single  object declaration  associates an identifier with a declared
object. The identifier, like every lexical element, is only a sequence
of characters.  But by  virtue of the declaration, it becomes possible
to use the identifier to refer to the declared object. We say that the
identifier is  a name  for the object: a name that denotes the object.
As we shall see, there are several forms of name. The simplest form is
just an identifier, which is therefore also called a simple name.
<p>
To illustrate other forms of name, consider the following declarations
(given in skeletal, but hopefully self-explanatory form):
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PERSON(SEX : GENDER) is
  record
    BIRTH :  DATE;
    ...
    SPOUSE :   ...   ;
  end record;

subtype KING is  PERSON(SEX =&gt;  M);

JOHN  :  KING;
LOUIS :  array (1 .. 18) of KING;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The above  declarations have defined several simple names: for example
JOHN is the simple name of an object of subtype KING, and LOUIS is the
simple name  of an array of kings. Now, starting with simple names, we
can form more complex names: a selected component such as
<p>
<PRE>    JOHN.SPOUSE
</PRE><p>
which denotes  a component of the record object that is itself denoted
by JOHN; and similarly an indexed component such as
<p>
<PRE>    LOUIS (9)
</PRE><p>
which denotes  a particular  component of  our array  of kings. We can
also combine  selected components  and indexed  components to form yet
more complex names such as
<p>
<PRE>LOUIS(15).SPOUSE
</PRE><p>
but not as in PL/1
<p>
<PRE>    LOUIS.SPOUSE(15)
</PRE><p>
Following <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Simula</a>  (and unlike <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>), Ada allows function calls to be
part of names. For example we can define a function HEIR as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function HEIR(N : POSITIVE) return KING is
begin
  if N &lt; 18 then
    return LOUIS(N + 1);
  else
    raise LINEAGE_ERROR;
  end if;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Now we can form names such as
<p>
<PRE>    HEIR(14).SPOUSE
</PRE><p>
which include  function calls.  Note that  the function  call HEIR(14)
delivers a  value (not  a variable), so that the above name allows the
SPOUSE component to be read, but not updated.
<p>
The ability  to use  function calls in names is especially useful when
dealing with  data structures  constructed with  access types. Thus an
algorithm in a tree traversal may include names such as
<p>
<PRE>    NEXT(N).PART
</PRE><p>
where NEXT(N)  delivers an access value, and where PART is a component
of the  object designated  by the  access value. In this case, reading
and updating of the component PART are both possible.
<p>
This ability  goes some  way toward the principle of uniform referents
advocated by Ross and others <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Ro 70, GM 75]</a>. Following this principle,
Ada uses round brackets rather than square brackets for denoting array
components, thereby  unifying the  syntax of  indexed  components  and
function calls.  In the same spirit, the syntax of selected components
is used  for component  selection of  records, whether the records are
statically or dynamically allocated (see <a href="ratl-06-03.html#6.3.4">6.3.4</a>).
