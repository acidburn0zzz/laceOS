<P>
The normal means of communicating values between tasks is  by  entry  calls
and accept statements. 
<P>
If  two  tasks  read  or  update  a  shared  variable  (that is, a variable
accessible by both), then neither of them may  assume  anything  about  the
order  in  which  the  other  performs its operations, except at the points
where they synchronize.  Two tasks are synchronized at the start and at the
end of their rendezvous.  At the start and at the end of its activation,  a
task  is  synchronized  with  the task that causes this activation.  A task
that has completed its execution is synchronized with any other task. 
<P>
For the actions performed by a program  that  uses  shared  variables,  the
following assumptions can always be made: 
<ul>
<li>If between two synchronization points of a task,  this  task  reads  a
shared  variable  whose  type  is  a  scalar  or access type, then the
variable is not updated by any other task at any  time  between  these
two points. 
<br><br>
<li>If between two synchronization points of a task, this task  updates  a
shared  variable  whose  type  is  a  scalar  or access type, then the
variable is neither read nor updated by any other  task  at  any  time
between these two points. 
</ul>
<P>
The  execution  of  the program is erroneous if any of these assumptions is
violated. 
<P>
If a given task reads the value of a shared variable, the above assumptions
allow an implementation to maintain local copies of the value (for example,
in registers or in some other form of temporary storage);  and for as  long
as  the  given task neither reaches a synchronization point nor updates the
value of the shared variable, the above assumptions  imply  that,  for  the
given  task,  reading  a  local  copy  is  equivalent to reading the shared
variable itself. 
<P>
Similarly, if a given task updates the value  of  a  shared  variable,  the
above  assumptions  allow an implementation to maintain a local copy of the
value, and to defer the effective store of the local copy into  the  shared
variable until a synchronization point, provided that every further read or
update  of the variable by the given task is treated as a read or update of
the local copy.  On the other hand, an implementation  is  not  allowed  to
introduce  a  store,  unless  this  store  would  also  be  executed in the
canonical order (see <a href="lrm-11-06.html#11.6">11.6</a>). 
<P>
The pragma SHARED can be used to specify that every read  or  update  of  a  
variable  is a synchronization point for that variable;  that is, the above
assumptions always hold for the given variable  (but  not  necessarily  for
other variables).  The form of this pragma is as follows: 
<pre>
    pragma SHARED(variable_simple_name);    
</pre>
<P>
This  pragma  is  allowed  only  for  a  variable  declared  by  an  object
declaration and whose type is  a  scalar  or  access  type;   the  variable
declaration  and  the  pragma  must  both occur (in this order) immediately
within the same declarative part or package specification;  the pragma must
appear before any occurrence of the name of the variable, other than in  an
address clause. 
<P>
An  implementation must restrict the objects for which the pragma SHARED is
allowed to objects for which each of direct reading and direct updating  is
implemented as an indivisible operation. 
<P>
