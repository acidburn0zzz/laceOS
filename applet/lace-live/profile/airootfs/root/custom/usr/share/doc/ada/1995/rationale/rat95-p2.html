<i>
     Part One  should have  given the reader an overall appreciation
     of the scope and some of the details of Ada 95.  The discussion
     included some  rationale for  the main  features but did not go
     into all the details.  This second part takes the discussion of
     the Core  language a  step further.   It covers those important
     features not discussed in Part One and gives more detail of the
     rationale  including  alternatives  that  were  considered  and
     rejected.   It is  assumed that the reader is familiar with the
     material in  Part One  which will  be referred  to from time to
     time.   It is recommended that this part be read in conjunction
     with the Ada 95 Reference Manual.
