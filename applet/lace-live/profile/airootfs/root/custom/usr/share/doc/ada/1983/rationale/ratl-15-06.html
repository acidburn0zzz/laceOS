<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.6">15.6 Configuration Specification and Environment Enquiries</a></H3>

To generate  object code,  some machine-  and  configuration-dependent
properties such  as  the  machine  model,  memory  size,  and  special
hardware  options  must  be  available  to  the  compiler.  Hence  the
specification of  configuration-dependent features  must be  possible.
Typical uses  of such  information are for the detection of exhaustion
of  various   resources,  and   the  generation   of   special-purpose
instructions for the target machine.
<p>
Conversely, programs  may need  to access information that is known to
the compiler.  There are  many uses for such information. A user-level
input-output  subprogram  may  need  to  invoke  different  algorithms
depending on the object machine configuration (with the discrimination
being made  at compilation  time); similarly,  it may need to know the
size of  the storage  unit for the object machine, and the size of the
objects transferred.
<p>
The approach used in Ada is to group such system-dependent information
in a  package called SYSTEM and to provide certain specific pragmas to
establish certain  characteristics that  may  vary  between  different
configurations of the system considered.

<H3><BR><a name="15.6.1">15.6.1 The Package SYSTEM</a></H3>

The  package   SYSTEM  includes  the  definition  of  system-dependent
information. At  the minimum  it will  include what  is shown  in  the
skeleton given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package SYSTEM is
  type ADDRESS   is implementation_defined;
  type NAME      is implementation_defined_enumeration_type;

  SYSTEM_NAME    :  constant NAME :=  implementation_defined;

  STORAGE_UNIT   :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  MEMORY_SIZE    :  constant :=  implementation_defined;

  -- System-Dependent Named Numbers:

  MIN_INT        :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  MAX_INT        :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  MAX_DIGITS     :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  MAX_MANTISSA   :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  FINE_DELTA     :  constant :=  implementation_defined;
  TICK           :  constant :=  implementation_defined;

  -- Other System-Dependent Declarations

  subtype PRIORITY is INTEGER range implementation_defined;

  ...
end SYSTEM;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The  type   ADDRESS  defines   what  addresses  are,  on  the  machine
considered: on  some machines  it will  be an  integer type,  on  some
others an  arbitrary record type. The type NAME is an enumeration type
that defines  names of  alternative machine  configurations  that  are
handled by the system. For example we could have:
<p>
<PRE>    type NAME is (MODEL_20, MODEL_40, MODEL_45, MODEL_70);</PRE>
<p>
As this  example suggests,  these possible  variations are  meaningful
when dealing  with variations of a machine that all have the same type
ADDRESS. Although  nothing forbids it, it would not make much sense to
have a type such as
<p>
<PRE>    type NAME is (VAX_11, IBM_370, APPLE_II);</PRE>
<p>
since the  other quantities defined in the package SYSTEM are unlikely
to be  the same  for these  alternative  machines.  For  example,  the
following constants are defined in the package:
<ul>
<li>SYSTEM_NAME: the name of the current configuration.
<p>
<li>STORAGE_UNIT: the number of bits per storage unit:
<p>
<li>MEMORY_SIZE: the number of storage units in the configuration.
</ul>

It is  a consequence  of the visibility rules that a declaration given
in the  (library) package  SYSTEM can be made visible within a program
unit that has a with clause that mentions SYSTEM. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
with SYSTEM;
procedure SPECIAL_APPLICATION is
  ...
  SIZE :  constant :=  SYSTEM.MEMORY_SIZE;
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The fact  that SYSTEM  needs to  be  mentioned  in  the  above  manner
provides an  easy way  of finding  out which program units make direct
use of system-dependent properties.

<H3><BR><a name="15.6.2">15.6.2 Pragmas for Configuration Specification</a></H3>

A particular  configuration of  the package  SYSTEM,  with  a  certain
configuration  name,  storage  unit  size,  and  memory  size  can  be
specified by means of corresponding pragmas. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
pragma SYSTEM_NAME(MODEL_45);
pragma STORAGE_UNIT(8);     -- 8 bits
pragma MEMORY_SIZE(2#1#E18);    -- 256 kbytes
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This has the effect of establishing the corresponding constants:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SYSTEM.SYSTEM_NAME   = MODEL_45
SYSTEM.STORAGE_UNIT  = 8
SYSTEM.MEMORY_SIZE   = 262_144
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="15.6.3">15.6.3 Representation Attributes</a></H3>

Representation attributes  provide an  environment  enquiry  mechanism
that can  be used to obtain information that is known by the compiler;
for example  to obtain the address of an object, subprogram, or entry,
the position  of record  components, or the size of objects of a given
type.
<p>
As mentioned in the section on lexical issues, an attribute designator
is always preceded by an apostrophe. The corresponding identifiers are
consequently not reserved. Some typical examples are given below.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
OLD_PSW'ADDRESS   -- the address in storage units of OLD_PSW
X.MASK'POSITION   -- the starting position of the component MASK in X
X.MASK'FIRST_BIT  -- the position of the first bit of MASK
X.MASK'LAST_BIT   -- the position of the last bit of MASK
INTEGER'SIZE      -- the implemented size of INTEGER in bits
</pre></td></tr></table>

<H3><BR><a name="15.6.4">15.6.4 Configuration Specification and Conditional Compilation</a></H3>

Sometimes it  is desirable  to write  and compile  a program  in which
portions vary  according to  the object  machine  configuration.  Such
conditional compilation can be achieved by conditional statements that
select from alternative program fragments. For example, a program that
provides different  algorithms for  different systems  may  appear  as
follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
pragma SYSTEM_NAME(MODEL_45);
...
case SYSTEM.SYSTEM_NAME is
  when MODEL_45 | MODEL_70 =&gt;
    ...
    -- part specific to models with full floating-point support

  when MODEL_40 =&gt;
    ...
    -- part specific to models with some floating-point support

  when MODEL_20 =&gt;
    ...
    -- part specific to models without floating-point support
end case;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The system  name established  by the  pragma is  known at  compilation
time, and  the  compiler  is  therefore  able  to  optimize  the  case
statement and  generate only  the code that corresponds to the current
system name. Thus the program can be tailored to a given machine.
<p>
This conditional  compilation facility  is  somewhat  primitive.  More
powerful mechanisms  for conditional  compilation  are  likely  to  be
provided by the support environments built around the Ada language.
