<H1>9.4 Postscript</H1>
<div class="Normal">Nothing is ever perfect and a number of small imperfections 
have been found in Ada 2005 since the Amendment was completed. We will 
briefly look at the more obvious of these.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Perhaps the most noticeable 
since it affects the syntax is described by two Ada Issues namely <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0015-1.TXT">AI05-15</A> 
and <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0053-1.TXT">AI05-53</A>. 
The former points out that in an extended return statement<A NAME="I1435"></A> 
it is useful to be able to mark a return object as <B>constant</B> whereas 
the latter concludes that it is unwise to be able to mark the object 
as <B>aliased</B>. So the syntax which reads&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>return</B>&nbsp;defining_identifer:&nbsp;[<B>aliased</B>]&nbsp;return_subtype_indication&nbsp;[:=&nbsp;expression}&nbsp;{<B>do</B></div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">should read&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>return</B>&nbsp;defining_identifer:&nbsp;[<B>constant</B>]&nbsp;return_subtype_indication&nbsp;[:=&nbsp;expression}&nbsp;{<B>do</B></div>
<div class="Normal"><B>Aliased</B> is unwise on the return object (the 
object in the extended return statement) because the result object (remember 
that the result of a function is itself an object and might indeed be 
providing the initial value of a limited object) need not be aliased 
and this can lead to some curious anomalies.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">Another issue concerning 
the extended return statement is <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0032-1.TXT">AI05-32</A> 
regarding class wide functions. In Section <A HREF="Rat-4-5.html">4.5</A> 
we saw that a function could return an indefinite type but nevertheless 
the return object could be declared to be constrained thus&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>function</B>&nbsp;Make(&nbsp;...&nbsp;)&nbsp;<B>return</B>&nbsp;UA&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
<B>begin</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>return</B>&nbsp;R:&nbsp;UA(1&nbsp;..&nbsp;N)&nbsp;<B>do</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;return</B>;<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;Make;</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The same rule should 
apply to class wide types. Thus if the return type is class wide such 
as Device'Class then we should be allowed to write&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>function</B>&nbsp;Make(&nbsp;...&nbsp;)&nbsp;<B>return</B>&nbsp;Device'Class&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
<B>begin</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>return</B>&nbsp;R:&nbsp;My_Device&nbsp;<B>do</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>end&nbsp;return</B>;<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;Make;</div>
<div class="Normal">where My_Device is covered by Device'Class. This 
is now permitted by <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0032-1.TXT">AI05-32</A>.</div>
<div class="Normal">Another issue regarding functions is that a function 
that returns an abstract type must be abstract (this was true in Ada 
95 of course). However, <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0073-1.TXT">AI05-73</A> 
points out that a function that returns an access to an abstract type 
must also be abstract in order to avoid dispatching problems.</div>
<div class="Normal">A trivial point is that a child package may not have 
a limited with clause<A NAME="I1436"></A> for its parent (<A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0040-1.TXT">AI05-40</A>). 
Limited with clauses are forbidden in a number of situations in order 
to avoid confusion. One such rule is that a package cannot have both 
a with clause and a limited with clause for the same unit. In the case 
of a child it effectively has an implicit with clause for its parent 
so disallowing a limited with clause is really the same rule.</div>
<div class="Normal">A further trivial point mentioned by <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0016-1.TXT">AI05-16</A> 
is that <SPAN Class="swiss">(<B>others</B> =&gt; &lt;&gt;)</SPAN> is 
permitted as an aggregate for a null record.<A NAME="I1437"></A><A NAME="I1438"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">There are a number of corrections and clarifications 
regarding categorization. One is that a limited view is always considered 
pure (<A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0034-1.TXT">AI05-34</A>). 
Another is that Preelaborable_Initialization<A NAME="I1439"></A><A NAME="I1440"></A> 
should not be restricted to just private types (<A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0028-1.TXT">AI05-28</A>).<A NAME="I1441"></A></div>
<div class="Normal">Two pragmas have been added by <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0009-1.TXT">AI05-9</A>. 
These are Independent and Independent_Components (much like Atomic and 
Atomic_Components).<A NAME="I1442"></A><A NAME="I1443"></A><A NAME="I1444"></A><A NAME="I1445"></A> 
They stipulate that the objects concerned are independently addressable 
and so can be manipulated independently without explicit synchronization 
in a multitasking program. This arose from consideration of confirming 
representation clauses.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">There are a number 
of issues concerning null exclusions. One is that null exclusions must 
textually match for full conformance. Thus we cannot write&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>package</B>&nbsp;P&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>type</B>&nbsp;T&nbsp;<B>is&nbsp;tagged&nbsp;null&nbsp;record</B>;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>procedure</B>&nbsp;Q(X:&nbsp;<B>access</B>&nbsp;T);<BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;P;<BR>
<B>package&nbsp;body</B>&nbsp;P&nbsp;<B>is</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>procedure</B>&nbsp;Q(X:&nbsp;<B>not&nbsp;null&nbsp;access</B>&nbsp;T);&nbsp;--&nbsp;<SPAN Class="roman"><I>illegal,&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;match</I></SPAN><BR>
<B>end</B>&nbsp;P;</div>
<div class="Normal">The standard as written doesn't cover this case since 
it can be argued that in the specification <SPAN Class="swiss">Q</SPAN> 
excludes null since it is controlling whereas in the body it excludes 
null because it says so. But <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0045-1.TXT">AI05-45</A> 
concludes that the intent was to require lexical matching to avoid confusion.</div>
<div class="Normal">Another issue concerning null exclusions is addressed 
by <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0062-1.TXT">AI05-62</A>. 
If a deferred constant has a null exclusion then the full declaration 
must also have a null exclusion. But the reverse is not true. If a deferred 
constant does not have a null exclusion then the full declaration might 
still have a null exclusion. This follows the same pattern as for constraints. 
If a deferred constant has a constraint then the full declaration must 
have a matching constraint but the reverse is not true.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">It will recalled that 
the issue of null exclusions causes a potential inconsistency between 
Ada 95 and Ada 2005.<A NAME="I1446"></A> See <A HREF="Rat-9-1-2.html">9.1.2</A>, 
item 4 and Section <A HREF="Rat-3-2.html">3.2</A>. It was therefore proposed 
that Ada 95 should permit <B>not null</B> in the specification of an 
access parameter thus&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SwissExamples"><B>procedure</B>&nbsp;P(X:&nbsp;<B>not&nbsp;null&nbsp;access</B>&nbsp;T);</div>
<div class="Normal">The idea was that for Ada 95 this was merely a comment 
but on transition to Ada 2005 it would give identical behaviour in all 
cases so that the inconsistency would be avoided. This was written up 
as <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AIs/AI-00447.TXT">AI95-447</A> 
and approved by the ARG. However, when it came to ratification by WG9 
a difficulty arose. From the point of view of ISO there is only ever 
one Ada standard and the current incarnation is what we call Ada 2005. 
Thus WG9 can no longer talk about Ada 95. Nevertheless compiler writers 
are encouraged to permit this &quot;comment&quot; in Ada 95 code (and 
a test has been added to the test suite).</div>
<div class="Normal">There are a number of other AIs regarding Ada 2005 
which cover matters such as corner cases in accessibility rules. These 
are too obscure to discuss here and are unlikely to impact on the typical 
programmer.</div>
<div class="Normal">However, it is hard to avoid the temptation to mention 
just one more AI with which to finish this brief survey. This concerns 
an error in the description of the procedure Set_Line. The idea of Set_Line 
is to move down the page and of course if the required line number is 
the current line number then do nothing. But if the current position 
is beyond the required position first do New_Page and then move down 
the page the required number of lines. Unfortunately, if the new position 
required is at the beginning of the page (that is the parameter of Set_Line 
is one) and New_Page is called then, according to the wording, this results 
in New_Line(0) being called and this does not do nothing as hoped but 
raises Constraint_Error because the parameter of New_Line is of the subtype 
Positive_Count which excludes zero! This error has been there since Ada 
83. Clearly all implementers have been doing the correct thing and just 
ignored the foolish wording. This is now corrected by <A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0038-1.TXT">AI05-38</A>.
