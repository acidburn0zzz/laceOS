<H2>CHAPTER 2: Lexical and Textual Structure</H2>

<H3><a name="2.2">2.2 Textual Structure</a></H3>
<p>
Above the lexical level, the text of a program is structured as an
arrangement of lexical elements. This structure is described by the
Ada syntax in the conventional manner. However, a number of issues
require separate discussion to clarify the decisions taken.
<p>
Declarations and statements are always terminated by semicolons - this
differs from the Pascal practice, in which a semicolon is used as a
separator. The Ada convention simplifies the insertion of another
declaration or statement: normal layout places the semicolon at the
end of a line and thus, where semicolons are separators, insertion of
a line often entails changing the previous line as well. This is an
argument against separators between items that are likely to be on
separate lines. We want each line to be a complete unit - therefore
including a terminator - so that adding a line does not require
changing a previous line. (Fortran achieves this by having the end of
line be a terminator.)
<p>
The use of semicolons as terminators aids recovery by the compiler
after finding a syntax error; recovery from omission of the semicolon
itself is usually quite simple for the parser. Finally, comparative
analyses of programmer errors have shown the use of semicolon as a
terminator to be less error-prone than its use as a separator <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[GH 75]</a>.
<p>
Having dealt with the lines of text themselves, we next consider the
two-dimensional arrangement of lexical elements to form a page.
Reading a page of a program normally proceeds on a line by line basis,
at least consciously. But reading and vision are indeed more complex
than is suggested by this purely linear process. While the eye
consciously concentrates on a given point (a given line), peripheral
vision is actively at work in a parallel fashion. This unconscious
reading activity provides us with information on the overall structure
of the text - the textual structure - and gradually develops our
intuition of what is coming in subsequent lines, and also our
perception of the spatial relationships of different parts of the
text.
<p>
A readable textual structure is one that facilitates this parallel
decoding activity: readability is thus improved by suitable
paragraphing (layout) of the program text. This facet of readability
has influenced the design of Ada textual structure in several ways.
For each of the major program structures, we have defined a textual
structure that reflects the underlying logical structure (this point
will be substantiated later by examples). This textual structure is
given by the recommended paragraphing specified in the Ada reference
manual through the layout of the syntax rules. Finally, the syntax was
designed in such a way that this recommended paragraphing can be
produced by very simple mechanical tools, on the basis of the reserved
words alone.
<p>
We should therefore expect Ada programs to be paragraphed in a
systematic and automatic manner. This consistency and uniformity of
presentation is a significant advantage for readers, in particular
when reading programs written by others. The resulting textual
structure is what will be perceived when looking at a program from a
distance, when the individual details (the individual lexical
elements) can no longer be seen distinctly. Even at this first level
of perception, a good program will provide us with some intuition of
its organization into major parts.
<p>
Some program structures have simple brackets, for example the loop and
end loop of the loop statement, and similarly the record and end
record of the record type definition. This simplifies the insertion of
additional statements or declarations. Thus, adding a statement to the
Ada if statement
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if COUNT &lt; AVERAGE then
 
     INCREASE(COUNT);
end if;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
requires a single line insertion:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if COUNT &lt; AVERAGE then
 
     PRINT(COUNT);                      -- added
     INCREASE(COUNT);
end if;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Note that the similar transformation of the Pascal if statement
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if COUNT &lt; AVERAGE then
 
     INCREASE(COUNT);</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
would be more cumbersome since it would require more modifications:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if COUNT &lt; AVERAGE then
 
     begin                   {added}
       PRINT(COUNT);         {added}
       INCREASE(COUNT)       {; deleted}
     end;                    {added}</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
and forgetting the begin ... end makes the increase of count
unconditional!
<p>
Several other program constructs exhibit a comb-like structure, which
is best illustrated with the if statement as in the following example:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>_____ if ... then

|
|                   ...
|
|               elsif ... then    
|
|                   ...
|
|               elsif ... then    
|
|                   ...
|
|               end if;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
This structure is built around four markers: an initial opening marker
(if ... then), two intermediate markers (elsif ... then), and a
closing marker (end if). Each of the three major parts bracketed by
two consecutive markers is a sequence of statements that forms one of
the alternatives of the if statement. Thus each major part of the comb
structure correspond to a logical alternative of the if statement. A
similar comb structure is exhibited by the case statement:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>_____ case LIGHT is
 
|
|                    when GREEN =&gt;     
|
|                        ...
|
|                    when AMBER =&gt;
|
|                        ...
|
|                    when RED =&gt;
|
|                        ...
|
|               end case;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>

Here again the layout defines three major parts of the text, which
correspond to the three logical alternatives of the case statement.
Further examples of the comb structure are
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>_____ procedure P is
 
|
|                   ...
|
|               begin
|
|                   ...
|
|               exception
|
|                   ...
|
|               end P;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>

<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>_____ select
|
|                   ...
|
|               or when ... =&gt;
|
|                   ...
|
|               or when ... =&gt;
|
|                   ...
|
|               else
|
|                   ...
|
|               end select;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>

Note that each large-scale comb structure has the terminating reserved
word end. For declarations and statements, this is followed by a
reserved word echoing the corresponding opening marker:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>case      end case
 
if        end if
 
loop      end loop
 
record    end record
 
select    end select</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
For named constructs such as subprograms, packages, and task units the
name of the construct may be written after the final end to assist in
the recognition of the structure, something which is quite useful in
the case of long program units:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>package KEY_MANAGER is
 
     ...
end KEY_MANAGER;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
When program constructs are nested, this pairing of opening and
closing markers will assist in reading the program. Special tools used
for printing (or displaying) programs may also print additional
vertical lines that further enhance the major structures as in the
example below:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>task body CONTROLLER is
|
| ...
|
begin
|
|    loop
|    |
|    |    select
|    |    |
|    |    |    accept READ ... do
|    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    ...
|    |    |    |
|    |    |    end READ;
|    |    |
|    |    or
|    |    |
|    |    |    accept WRITE ... do
|    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    ...
|    |    |    |
|    |    |    end WRITE;
|    |    |
|    |    end select;
|    |
|    end loop;
|
end CONTROLLER;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Naturally, these structural vertical lines are not part of the input
text submitted to an Ada compiler, any more than are font indications
such as the use of boldface for reserved words. Such enhancing
techniques are not superfluous: they have an important role in
facilitating the reading of programs, an important activity in our
profession.
<p>
In general, language constructs which do not express similar ideas
should not look similar. Thus, unlike Pascal which used a colon in
both cases, Ada uses different notations for statement labels (used by
goto statements) and for choices (in case statements). Statement
labels have angle brackets <CODE>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</CODE> placed around the label identifier;
they emphasize that this is a special point in the program.
Conversely, choices express preconditions for executing the statements
that follow. Their form is therefore as follows:
<p>
<PRE>    when ... =&gt;</PRE>
<p>
The same form is also used in select statements and exception
handlers, since it corresponds to the same idea of a precondition.
<p>
Whenever possible, a uniform notation is used for similar constructs.
The clearest example of this principle is the case structure, which is
used for variant parts in records as well as for case statements. In
Ada, both constructs have the same morphology, so as to reflect the
common idea of discrimination among several alternatives: seen from a
distance the two structures are indistinguishable. This should
simplify teaching of the language and avoid programming errors.
<p>
Pascal variant parts and case statements, although similar, do not
follow our principle. The contrast is illustrated by an example:
<p>
A graphics data structure in Pascal:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type SHAPE =  (CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, POINT);
 
type FIGURE =
     record
          X, Y :  REAL;
          case KIND :  SHAPE of
               CIRCLE:
                    (RADIUS :  REAL);
               TRIANGLE:
                    (INCLINATION, ANGLE  :  REAL;
                    LEFT_SIDE, RIGHT_SIDE   :  REAL);
               POINT:()
     end
</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
A case statement in Pascal:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>case A.KIND of
 
     CIRCLE:
          PRINT(A.RADIUS);
     TRIANGLE:
          begin
             PRINT(A.INCLINATION);  PRINT(A.ANGLE);
             PRINT(A.LEFT_SIDE); PRINT(A.RIGHT_SIDE)
          end;
     POINT:
end</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
The equivalent data structure in Ada:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type SHAPE is (CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, POINT);
 
type FIGURE(KIND :  SHAPE) is
     record
          X, Y :  REAL;
               case KIND is
                    when CIRCLE =&gt;
                         RADIUS :  REAL;
                    when TRIANGLE =&gt;
                         INCLINATION, ANGLE  :  REAL;
                         LEFT_SIDE, RIGHT_SIDE :  REAL;
                    when POINT =&gt;
                         null;
               end case;
     end record</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The equivalent case statement in Ada:
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>case A.KIND is
     when CIRCLE =&gt;
          PRINT(A.RADIUS);
     when TRIANGLE =&gt;
          PRINT(A.INCLINATION);  PRINT(A.ANGLE);
          PRINT(A.LEFT_SIDE); PRINT(A.RIGHT_SIDE);
     when POINT =&gt;
          null;
end case;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
In Ada, the structural analogy between the declarative case structure
(the variant part) and the case statement should assist the human
reader and help in learning the language. The approach will also
simplify pretty-printing of programs by mechanical tools which need
not be able to distinguish the two (semantically different) versions
of the case structure, namely variant parts and case statements.
<p>
A similar structural analogy exists between the case statement, the
select statement, and exception handlers. Other structural analogies,
which are adequately reflected by the syntax, are shown by the textual
structure of functions, procedures, package bodies, task bodies, and
blocks. In each case the syntax defines three major logical parts (a
declarative part, a sequence of statements, and exception handlers)
that are reflected by the textual structure
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   function F ... is      procedure P ... is      declare
   |                      |                       |
   |                      |                       |
   |      begin           |      begin            |    begin            
   |                      |                       |
   |                      |                       |
   |      exception       |      exception        |    exception
   |                      |                       |
   |                      |                       |
   |      end F;          |      end P;           |    end
  </pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   package body P is      task body T is
   |                      |         
   |                      |    
   |     begin            |     begin            
   |                      |    
   |                      |    
   |     exception        |     exception     
   |                      |    
   |                      |    
   |     end P;           |     end T;   
</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
and similarly for package and task specifications
<p><table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   package P is        task T is
   |                   |
   |                   |
   |     end P;        |     end T        </pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
These structural analogies have been used quite systematically. They
should develop a feeling of familiarity for the reader and simplify
the teaching of the Ada language.
