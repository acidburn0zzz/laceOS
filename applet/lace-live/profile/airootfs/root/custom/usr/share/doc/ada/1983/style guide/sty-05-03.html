In addition to determining the possible values for variables, type names, and  
distinctions can be very valuable aids in developing safe, readable, and  
understandable code. Types clarify the structure of your data and can limit or  
restrict the operations performed on that data. &quot;Keeping types distinct has 
been found to be a very powerful means of detecting logical mistakes when a  
program is written and to give valuable assistance whenever the program is  
being subsequently maintained.&quot; (Pyle 1985)  Take advantage of Ada's strong  
typing capability in the form of subtypes, derived types, task types, private  
types, and limited private types.<P>
The guidelines encourage much code to be written to ensure strong typing 
(i.e., subtypes). While it might appear that there would be execution 
penalties for this amount of code, this is usually not the case. In contrast 
to other conventional languages, Ada has a less direct relationship between 
the amount of code that is written and the size of the resulting executable 
program. Most of the strong type checking is performed at compilation time 
rather than execution time, so the size of the executable code is not greatly 
affected.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use existing types as building blocks by deriving new types from them. 
<li>Use range constraints on subtypes. 
<li>Define new types, especially derived types, to include the largest set  of possible values, including boundary values. 
<li> Constrain the ranges of derived types with subtypes, excluding 
boundary values. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Type <CODE>Table</CODE> is a building block for the creation of new types:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Table is 
   record 
      Count : List_Size  := Empty; 
      List  : Entry_List := Empty_List; 
   end record;
   
type Telephone_Directory  is new Table; 
type Department_Inventory is new Table;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
The following are distinct types that cannot be intermixed in operations that  
are not programmed explicitly to use them both:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Dollars is new Number; 
type Cents   is new Number;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
Below, <CODE>Source_Tail</CODE> has a value outside the range of <CODE>Listing_Paper</CODE> when the 
line is empty. All the indices can be mixed in expressions, as long as the 
results fall within the correct subtypes:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Columns          is range First_Column - 1 .. Listing_Width + 1; 
subtype Listing_Paper is 
      Columns range First_Column .. Listing_Width; 
subtype Dumb_Terminal is 
      Columns range First_Column .. Dumb_Terminal_Width;
      
type Line             is array (Columns range &lt;&gt;) of Bytes; 
subtype Listing_Line  is Line (Listing_Paper); 
subtype Terminal_Line is Line (Dumb_Terminal);

Source_Tail : Columns       := Columns'First; 
Source      : Listing_Line; 
Destination : Terminal_Line;

...

Destination(Destination'First .. Source_Tail - Destination'Last) := 
      Source(Columns'Succ(Destination'Last) .. Source_Tail);</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The name of a derived type can make clear its intended use and avoid 
proliferation of similar type definitions. Objects of two derived types, even 
though derived from the same type, cannot be mixed in operations unless such 
operations are supplied explicitly or one is converted to the other 
explicitly.  This prohibition is an enforcement of strong typing.<P>
Define new types, derived types, and subtypes cautiously and deliberately. The  
concepts of subtype and derived type are not equivalent, but they can be used  
to advantage in concert. A subtype limits the range of possible values for a  
type, but does not define a new type.<P>
Types can have highly constrained sets of values without eliminating useful  
values. Used in concert, derived types and subtypes can eliminate many flag  
variables and type conversions within executable statements. This renders the  
program more readable, enforces the abstraction, and allows the compiler to  
enforce strong typing constraints.<P>
Many algorithms begin or end with values just outside the normal range. If 
boundary values are not compatible within subexpressions, algorithms can be 
needlessly complicated. The program can become cluttered with flag variables 
and special cases when it could just test for zero or some other sentinel 
value just outside normal range.<P>
The type <CODE>Columns</CODE> and the subtype <CODE>Listing_Paper</CODE> in the example above 
demonstrate how to allow sentinel values. The subtype <CODE>Listing_Paper</CODE> could be 
used as the type for parameters of subprograms declared in the specification 
of a package.  This would restrict the range of values which could be 
specified by the caller.  Meanwhile, the type <CODE>Columns</CODE> could be used to store 
such values internally to the body of the package, allowing <CODE>First_Column - 1</CODE> 
to be used as a sentinel value. This combination of types and subtypes allows 
compatibility between subtypes within subexpressions without type conversions 
as would happen with derived types.

<H4>note</H4>
The price of the reduction in the number of independent type declarations is  
that subtypes and derived types change when the base type is redefined. This  
trickle-down of changes is sometimes a blessing and sometimes a curse. However, 
usually it is intended and beneficial.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Avoid anonymous types. 
<li>Use anonymous types for array variables when no suitable type exists  
and the array will not be referenced as a whole. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Use
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Buffer_Index is range 1 .. 80; 
type Buffer       is array (Buffer_Index) of Character;

Input_Line : Buffer;</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Input_Line : array (Buffer_Index) of Character;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Although Ada allows anonymous types, they have limited usefulness and  
complicate program modification. For example, except for arrays, a variable of  
anonymous type can never be used as an actual parameter because it is not  
possible to define a formal parameter of the same type. Even though this may  
not be a limitation initially, it precludes a modification in which a piece of  
code is changed to a subprogram. Also, two variables declared using the same  
anonymous type declaration are actually of different types.<P>
Even though the implicit conversion of array types during parameter passing is 
supported in Ada, it is difficult to justify not using the type of the 
parameter.  In most situations, the type of the parameter is visible and 
easily substituted in place of an anonymous array type.  The use of an 
anonymous array type implies that the array is only being used as a convenient 
way to implement a collection of values.  It is misleading to use an anonymous 
type and then treat the variable as an object.

<H4>note</H4>
For anonymous task types, see <a href="sty-06-01.html#6.1.2">Guideline 6.1.2</a>.<P>
In reading the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual</a> (Department of Defense 1983), you  
will notice that there are cases when anonymous types are mentioned abstractly  
as part of the description of the Ada computational model. These cases do not  
violate this guideline.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use limited private types in preference to private types.  
<li>Use private types in preference to nonprivate types. 
<li>Explicitly export needed operations rather than easing restrictions.

   type Frame_Header is limited private; 
   type Frame_Data   is private; 
   type Frame_Codes  is (Main_Bus_Voltage, Transmitter_1_Power);

      record

end Packet_Telemetry;

<H4>rationale</H4>
Limited private types and private types support abstraction and information  
hiding better than nonprivate types. The more restricted the type, the better  
information hiding is served. This, in turn, allows the implementation to  
change without affecting the rest of the program. While there are many valid  
reasons to export types, it is better to try the preferred route first,  
loosening the restrictions only as necessary. If it is necessary for a user of  
the package to use a few of the restricted operations, it is better to export  
the operations explicitly and individually via exported subprograms than to  
drop a level of restriction. This practice retains the restrictions on other  
operations. <P>
Limited private types have the most restricted set of operations available to  
users of a package. Of the types that must be made available to users of a  
package, as many as possible should be limited private. The operations  
available to limited private types are membership tests, selected components,  
components for the selections of any discriminant, qualification and explicit  
conversion, and attributes <CODE>'Base</CODE> and <CODE>'Size</CODE>. Objects of a limited private type  
also have the attribute <CODE>'Constrained</CODE> if there are discriminants. None of these  
operations allow the user of the package to manipulate objects in a way that  
depends on the structure of the type.<P>
If additional operations must be available to the type, the restrictions may 
be loosened by making it a private type. The operations available on objects 
of nprivate types that are not available on objects of limited private types 
are assignment and tests for equality and inequality. There are advantages to 
the restrictive nature of limited private types. For example, assignment 
allows copies of an object to be made. This could be a problem if the object's 
type is a pointer.

<H4>note</H4>
The predefined packages Direct_IO and Sequential_IO do not accept limited  
private types as generic parameters.  This restriction should be considered  
when I/O operations are needed for a type.<P>
