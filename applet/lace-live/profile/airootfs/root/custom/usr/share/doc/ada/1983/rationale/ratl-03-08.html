<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.8">3.8 Assignment Statements - The Ada Model of Time</a></H3>

The assignment  statement is  usually regarded  as the simplest of all
statements, and we will use this statement to discuss the Ada model of
time flow.
<p>
One issue  that must  be addressed  in  any  language  design  is  the
definition of  the sequencing  of elementary  operations. One  extreme
corresponds to  operational definitions  in which  this sequencing  is
defined exhaustively,  for all  features of  the language, and for all
possible elementary operations.
<p>
The view  adopted in Ada, following the <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 68</a> concept of collateral
evaluation, uses  a somewhat  simpler mental  model of  sequencing. We
consider that  time differences only matter at certain specific points
of the  program -  mainly at  the semicolons that terminate statements
and declarations.  This means  that the  sequencing of certain actions
that occur  between two  consecutive  semicolons  is  not  necessarily
defined  by   the  language.   Consider  for  example,  the  following
assignment statements:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
OUT_ROW(FLOOR(X))  :=  IN_ROW(CEIL(Y));
X :=  SIN(Y)&#42;COS(Y) - TAN(Z);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
where we  assume OUT_ROW  and IN_ROW  to be  arrays, FLOOR, CEIL to be
functions, and  X, Y,  Z to  be variables. For assignments statements,
the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada reference manual</a> specifies that the evaluation of the left and
right hand  sides is  done in  some order  that is  not defined by the
language. This  means that the language does not define which of FLOOR
and CEIL  is called  first. Similarly,  whereas the  precedence  rules
require the right hand side of the second assignment to mean
<PRE>    (SIN(Y)&#42;COS(Y)) - TAN(Z)
</PRE><p>
the rules  of expression  evaluation leave  the order of evaluation of
the function  calls undefined.  Thus it  would  be  possible  for  the
functions to be called in any of the following orders:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
(1) TAN (2) SIN (3) COS
(1) TAN (2) COS (3) SIN
(1) SIN (2) COS (3) TAN
(1) COS (2) SIN (3) TAN
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The only  (and partial)  order imposed  comes  from  the  ordering  of
statements and  from the logic of operations. Thus the ordering of the
two statements  requires that  a function  call (such as FLOOR) of the
first assignment  statement occur before a function call (such as SIN)
of the  second. Similarly,  the logic  of operations requires that the
multiplication be  performed after  the evaluation of its two operands
(SIN(Y) and COS(Y)).
<p>
The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada  reference manual </a>further specifies (<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-01-06.html#1.6">RM 1.6</a>) that if different
parts of  a given  construct are  to be executed in some order that is
not defined  by the  language, then  the  construct  is  incorrect  if
execution of  these parts  in a different order would have a different
effect: this kind of error is called an incorrect order dependence.
<p>
In terms  of programming methodology, this means that we must consider
the flow  of time  to be  given by  the sequencing of statements, each
simple statement  being considered  as an  indivisible action.  In the
above example,  the first  assignment would be incorrect if its effect
depended on  the order  of evaluation  of FLOOR  and CEIL. Should this
order actually  matter, then the proper way to write the program would
be to  give a  sequence of assignments that defines the intended order
explicitly. For example:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
U  :=  FLOOR(X); -- guarantees that FLOOR
V  :=  CEIL(Y); -- is called before CEIL
OUT_ROW(U)  :=  IN_ROW(V);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Similar   considerations   apply   to   expression   evaluation.   All
constituents of an expression (aside from short-circuit control forms)
must be  evaluated, although  the evaluation  order is not defined for
all terms.  Hence if  an exception is raised by the evaluation of some
term, then  this  exception  cannot  be  avoided.  In  this  sense  an
expression such as
<PRE>    A = 0  or  X/A &gt; 10
</PRE><p>
although syntactically  correct, is  not proper  since the validity of
the right  operand of  or depends  on the  value of  the left operand.
Whenever there  is such  a dependence,  it should  be made explicit by
means of  conditional statements,  or by  short-circuit control  forms
(see <a href="ratl-03-10.html#3.10">3.10</a>),  in order  to  emphasize  the  possibility  of  incomplete
evaluation. For example:
<PRE>    A = 0  or else  X/A &gt; 10
</PRE><p>
Note finally  that whenever order is not defined, the reference manual
uses the  phrase in  some order  that is  not defined, rather than the
phrase in  any order. The intent of the chosen wording is to leave the
order undefined  but nevertheless  require that  it be  done  in  some
order, and thus exclude parallel evaluation.
<p>
To illustrate  this point, consider again the calls of FLOOR and CEIL,
and assume  that the values obtained do not depend on whether FLOOR or
CEIL is  called first.  It  is  nevertheless  possible  that  parallel
evaluation of FLOOR and CEIL will yield a different effect. Thus FLOOR
and CEIL  could be  memo-functions, which  remember past  intermediate
results (for efficiency). Should some of these intermediate results be
used by both FLOOR and CEIL, then it would be possible for interleaved
executions of  these functions  to deliver  different -  and  probably
incoherent - results.
