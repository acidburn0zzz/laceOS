<H2>CHAPTER 8: Reusability</H2>

Reusability is the extent to which code can be used in different applications 
with minimal change. As code is reused in a new application, that new 
application partially inherits the attributes of that code. If it is 
maintainable, the application is more maintainable. If it is portable, then 
the application is more portable. So this chapter's guidelines are most useful 
when all of the other guidelines in this book are also applied.<P>
Several guidelines are directed at the issue of maintainability. Maintainable 
code is easy to change to meet new or changing requirements. Maintainability 
plays a special role in reuse. When attempts are made to reuse code, it is 
often necessary to change it to suit the new application. If the code cannot 
be changed easily, it is less likely to be reused.<P>
There are many issues involved in software reuse: whether to reuse parts, how 
to store and retrieve reusable parts in a library, how to certify parts, how 
to maximize the economic value of reuse, how to provide incentives to 
engineers and entire companies to reuse parts rather than reinvent them, and 
so on. This chapter ignores these managerial, economic, and logistic issues to 
focus on the single technical issue of how to write software parts in Ada to 
increase reuse potential. The other issues are just as important but are 
outside of the scope of this book.<P>
One of the design goals of Ada was to facilitate the creation and use of 
reusable parts to improve productivity. To this end, Ada provides features to 
develop reusable parts and to adapt them once they are available. Packages, 
visibility control, and separate compilation support modularity and 
information hiding (see Guidelines <a href="sty-04-01.html#4.1">4.1</a>,
<a href="sty-04-02.html#4.2">4.2</a>,
<a href="sty-05-03.html#5.3">5.3</a>, and
<a href="sty-05-07.html#5.7">5.7</a>). This allows the separation of 
application-specific parts of the code, maximizes the general purpose parts 
suitable for reuse, and allows the isolation of design decisions within 
modules, facilitating change. The Ada type system supports localization of 
data definitions so that consistent changes are easy to make. Generic units 
directly support the development of general purpose, adaptable code that can 
be instantiated to perform specific functions. Using these features carefully, 
and in conformance to the guidelines in this book, produces code that is more 
likely to be reusable.<P>
Reusable code is developed in many ways. Code may be scavenged from a previous  
project. A reusable library of code may be developed from scratch for a  
particularly well understood domain: such as a math library. Reusable code may  
be developed as an intentional byproduct of a specific application. Reusable  
code may be developed a certain way because a design method requires it. These  
guidelines are intended to apply in all of these situations.<P>
The experienced programmer recognizes that software reuse is much more a  
requirements and design issue than a coding issue. The guidelines in this  
section are intended to work within an overall method for developing reusable  
code. This section will not deal with artifacts of design, testing, etc. Some  
research into reuse issues related specifically to the Ada language can be  
found in AIRMICS (1990), Edwards (1990), and Wheeler (1992).<P>
Regardless of development method, experience indicates that reusable code has  
certain characteristics, and this chapter makes the following assumptions:
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>Reusable parts must be understandable. A reusable part should be a  
model of clarity. The requirements for commenting reusable parts are even more  
stringent than those for parts specific to a particular application.  
<li> Reusable parts must be of the highest possible quality. They must be 
correct, reliable, and robust. An error or weakness in a reusable part may 
have far-reaching consequences, and it is important that other programmers can 
have a high degree of confidence in any parts offered for reuse. 
<li>Reusable parts must be adaptable. To maximize its reuse potential, a  
part must be able to adapt to the needs of a wide variety of users. 
<li>Reusable parts should be independent. It should be possible to reuse a  
single part without also adopting many other parts that are apparently  
unrelated. 
</UL>
In addition to these criteria, a reusable part must be easier to reuse than to  
reinvent, must be efficient, and must be portable. If it takes more effort to  
reuse a part than to create one from scratch, or if the reused part is simply  
not efficient enough, reuse does not occur as readily. For guidelines on  
portability, see <a href="sty-07.html">Chapter 7</a>.<P>
This chapter should not be read in isolation. In many respects, a 
well-written, reusable component is simply an extreme example of a 
well-written component.  All of the guidelines in the previous chapters apply 
to reusable components as well as components specific to a single application. 
The guidelines listed here apply specifically to reusable components.
