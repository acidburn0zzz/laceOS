<H1>1.2 Scope of revision</H1>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The changes from Ada 
83 to Ada 95 were large. They included several major new items such as 
</div>
<div class="Bulleted">polymorphism through tagged types, class-wide types 
and dispatching,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">the hierarchical library system including public 
and private child packages,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">protected objects for better real-time control,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">more comprehensive predefined library, especially 
for character and string handling,</div>
<div class="Bulleted">specialized annexes such as those for system programming, 
real-time, and numerics.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">By contrast the changes from Ada 95 to Ada 2005 are 
relatively modest. Ada 95 was almost a new language which happened to 
be compatible with Ada 83. However, a new language always brings surprises 
and despite very careful design things do not always turn out quite as 
expected when used in earnest.</div>
<div class="Normal">Indeed, a number of errors in the Ada 95 standard 
were corrected in the Corrigendum issued in 2001 <A HREF="Rat-0-2.html#R2">[2]</A> 
and then incorporated into the Consolidated Ada Reference Manual <A HREF="Rat-0-2.html#R3">[3]</A>. 
But it was still essentially the same language and further improvement 
needed to be done.</div>
<div class="Normal">Technically, Ada 2005 is defined as an Amendment 
to rather than a Revision of the Ada 95 standard and this captures the 
flavour of the changes as not being very extensive.</div>
<div class="Normal">In a sense we can think of Ada 2005 as rounding out 
the rough edges in Ada 95 rather than making major leaps forward. This 
is perhaps not quite true of the Real-Time Systems annex which includes 
much new material of an optional nature. Nevertheless I am sure that 
the changes will bring big benefits to users at hopefully not too much 
cost to implementors.</div>
<div class="Normal">The scope of the Amendment was guided by a document 
issued by WG9 to the ARG in September 2002 <A HREF="Rat-0-2.html#R1">[1]</A>. 
The key paragraph is:</div>
<div class="Normal">&quot;The main purpose of the Amendment is to address 
identified problems in Ada that are interfering with Ada's usage or adoption, 
especially in its major application areas (such as high-reliability, 
long-lived real-time and/or embedded applications and very large complex 
systems). The resulting changes may range from relatively minor, to more 
substantial.&quot;</div>
<div class="Normal">Note that by saying &quot;identified problems&quot; 
it implicitly rejects a major redesign such as occurred with Ada 95. 
The phrase in parentheses draws attention to the areas where Ada has 
a major market presence. Ada has carved an important niche in the safety-critical 
areas which almost inevitably are of a real-time and/or embedded nature. 
But Ada is also in successful use in very large systems where the inherent 
reliability and composition features are extremely valuable. So changes 
should aim to help in those areas. And the final sentence is really an 
exhortation to steer a middle course between too much change and not 
enough.</div>
<div class="Normal">The document then identifies two specific worthwhile 
changes, namely, inclusion of the Ravenscar profile <A HREF="Rat-0-2.html#R4">[4]</A> 
(for predictable real-time) and a solution to the problem of mutually 
dependent types across two packages (see Section <A HREF="Rat-1-3-3.html">1.3.3</A> 
below).</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The ARG is then requested 
to pay particular attention to&nbsp;</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">A</div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Improvements that will maintain or improve Ada's advantages, especially 
in those user domains where safety and criticality are prime concerns. 
Within this area it cites as high priority, improvements in the real-time 
features and improvements in the high integrity features. Of lesser priority 
are features that increase static error checking. Improvements in interfacing 
to other languages are also mentioned.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">B</div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Improvements that will remedy shortcomings in Ada. It cites in particular 
improvements in OO features, specifically, adding a Java-like interface 
feature and improved interfacing to other OO languages.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="Normal">So the ARG is asked to improve both OO and real-time 
with a strong emphasis on real-time and high integrity features. It is 
interesting that WG9 rejected the thought that &quot;design by contract&quot; 
features should be added to the above general categories on the grounds 
that they would not be static.</div>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The ARG is also asked 
to consider the following factors in selecting features for inclusion: 
</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Implementability. Can the feature be implemented 
at reasonable cost?</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Need. Do users actually need it? [A good one!]</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Language stability. Would it appear disturbing 
to current users?</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Competition and popularity. Does it help to improve 
the perception of Ada and make it more competitive?</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Interoperability. Does it ease problems of interfacing 
with other languages and systems? [That's the third mention of interfacing.]</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Language consistency. Is it syntactically and semantically 
consistent with the language's current structure and design philosophy? 
</div>
<div class="Normal">An important further statement is that &quot;In order 
to produce a technically superior result, it is permitted to compromise 
backwards compatibility when the impact on users is judged to be acceptable.&quot; 
In other words don't be paranoid about compatibility.</div>
<div class="Normal">Finally, there is a warning about secondary standards. 
Its essence is don't use secondary standards if you can get the material 
into the RM itself. And please put the stuff on vectors and matrices 
from ISO/IEC 13813 <A HREF="Rat-0-2.html#R5">[5]</A> into the language 
itself. The reason for this exhortation is that secondary standards have 
proved themselves to be almost invisible and hence virtually useless.</div>
<div class="Normal">The guidelines conclude with the target schedule. 
This includes WG9 approval of the scope of the amendment in June 2004 
which was achieved and submission to ISO/IEC JTC1 in late 2005.</div>
