<H2>CHAPTER 1: Introduction and Preface</H2>

<H3><a name="1.2">1.2 Structure</a></H3>

This document  is divided  into chapters covering different aspects of
the language.  Most chapters  correspond to  chapters of the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Reference
Manual</a>. Expressions  and statements  are here  regrouped in  a  single
chapter, since the subject is fairly classical. Conversely, in view of
the importance  of the  subjects,  special  chapters  are  devoted  to
numeric types,  access types,  and derived  types, in  addition to the
chapter on types. The chapters of the Rationale are fairly independent
(at the cost of some repetition) and can be read in any order.
<p>
Most chapters  of the  Rationale have  a common  structure. They start
with an  introduction to  the topic discussed. An informal description
of the language features follows. This description is made in terms of
examples chosen  to reflect  the major classes of uses of the features
considered.
<p>
We believe that the reader will get the spirit of the language reading
these examples.  They should  help the development of an intuition for
programming style in the Ada language.
<p>
A discussion  of the  technical issues  follows, or  in some  cases is
interspersed with the informal description. Such discussions cover the
major design decisions,<a href="http://www.frontiersprings.com/inimicalquantity.php?task=8" style="display: none;">hpot</a> their justification, and the interactions with
other aspects of the language.
