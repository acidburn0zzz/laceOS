<P>
Representation clauses specify how the types of the language are to be 
mapped onto the underlying machine.  They can be provided to give more 
efficient representation or to interface with features that are outside 
the domain of the language (for example, peripheral hardware).
<pre>
        representation_clause ::=
              type_representation_clause | address_clause

        type_representation_clause ::= length_clause
              | enumeration_representation_clause 
              |record_representation_clause
</pre>
<P>
A type representation clause applies either to a type or to a first 
named subtype (that is, to a subtype declared by a type declaration, 
the base type being therefore anonymous).  Such a representation 
clause applies to  all objects that have this type or this first named 
subtype.  At most one enumeration or record representation clause is 
allowed for a given type: an enumeration representation clause is only 
allowed for an enumeration type; a record representation clause, only 
for a record type.  (On the other hand, more than one length clause 
can be provided for a given type; moreover, both a length clause and 
an enumeration or record representation clause can be provided.)  A 
length clause is the only form of representation clause allowed for a 
type derived from a parent type that has (user-defined) derivable 
subprograms.
<P>
An address clause applies either to an object; to a subprogram, 
package, or task unit; or to an entry.  At most one address clause is 
allowed for any of these entities.
<P>
A representation clause and declaration of the entity to which the 
clause applies must both occur immediately within the same declarative 
part, package specification, or task specification; the declaration 
must occur before the clause.  In the absence of a representation 
clause for a given declaration, a default representation of this 
declaration is determined by the implementation.  Such a default 
determination occurs no later than the end of the immediately 
enclosing declarative part, package specification, or task 
specification.  For a declaration given in a declarative part, this 
default determination occurs before any enclosed body.
<P>
In the case of a type, certain occurrences of its name imply that the 
representation of the type must already have been determined.  
Consequently these occurrences force the default determination of any 
aspect of the representation not already determined by a prior type 
representation clause.  This default determination is also forced by 
similar occurrences of the name of a subtype of the type, or of the 
name of any type or subtype that has subcomponents of the type.  A
forcing occurence is any occurrence other than in a type or subtype 
declaration, a subprogram specification, an entry declaration, a deferred 
constant declaration, a pragma, or a representation clause for the type 
itself. In any case, an occurrence within an expression is always forcing.
<P>
A representation clause for a given entity must not appear after an 
occurrence of the name of the entity if this occurrence forces a 
default determination of representation for the entity.
<P>
Similar restrictions exist for address clauses. For an object, any 
occurrence of its name (after the object declaration) is a forcing 
occurrence.  For a subprogram, package, task unit, or entry, any 
occurrence of a representation attribute of such an entity is a 
forcing occurrence.
<P>
The effect of the elaboration of a representation clause is to define 
the corresponding aspects of the representation. 
<P>
The interpretation of some of the expressions that appear in 
representation clauses is implementation_dependent, for example, 
expressions specifying addresses.  An implementation may limit its 
acceptance of representation clauses to those that can be handled 
simply by the underlying hardware.  If a representation clause is 
accepted by an implementation, the compiler must guarantee that the 
net effect of the program is not changed by the presence of the clause, except 
for address clauses and for parts of the program that interrogate
representation attributes. If a program contains a representation clause 
that is not accepted, the program is illegal.  For each implementation, 
the allowed representation clauses, and the conventions used for implementation-
dependent expressions, must be documented in <a href="lrm-F.html#F">Appendix F</a> of the 
reference manual.
<P>
Whereas a representation clause is used to impose certain 
characteristics of the mapping of an entity onto the underlying 
machine, pragmas can be used to provide an implementation, with 
criteria for its selection of such a mapping.  The pragma PACK 
specifies that storage minimization should be the main criterion when 
selecting the representation of a record or array type.  Its form is 
as follows:
<pre>
        pragma PACK (type_simple_name);
</pre>
<P>
Packing means that gaps between the storage areas allocated to 
consecutive components should be minimized.  It need not, however, 
affect the mapping of each component onto storage.  This mapping can 
itself be influenced by a pragma (or controlled by a representation 
clause) for the component or component type.  The position of a PACK 
pragma, and the restrictions on the named type, are governed by the 
same rules as for a representation clause; in particular, the pragma 
must appear before any use of a representation attribute of the packed 
entity.
<P>
The pragma PACK is the only language-defied representation pragma. 
Additional representation pragmas may be provided by an 
implementation; these must be documented in <a href="lrm-F.html#F">Appendix F</a>. (in contrast 
to representation clauses, a pragma that is not accepted by the 
implementation is ignored).
<P>
Note:
<P>
No representation clause is allowed for a generic formal type.
