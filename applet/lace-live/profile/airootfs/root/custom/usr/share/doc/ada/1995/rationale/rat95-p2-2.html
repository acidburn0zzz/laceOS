<h1>
2   Lexical Elements
</h1>

<p>
There are only a small number of changes in this part of the language but
they are important.  The following are worth noting
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  There are six more reserved words.
<li>
    The program text character set is extended.
<li>
    The rules regarding pragmas are improved.
</ul>

2.1  Reserved Words and Identifiers
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Ada 95 has six more reserved words which are abstract, aliased,
protected, requeue, tagged, and until.  In addition the word "access" is
also used as both an attribute and a reserved word.
</p>
<p>
The introduction of new reserved words poses a potential
incompatibility problem.  However, the new words are not likely to have
been particularly popular as program identifiers and so little problem
should arise.
</p>
<p>
   It was suggested by some reviewers that new reserved words should be
avoided by the subtle reuse of existing words in various contexts.  This
might have led to a bizarre and unnatural language for the sake of
avoiding very occasional incompatibility.  It would certainly have made
the language seem strange and unattractive especially to those not
familiar with the background to the development.  The smooth integration
of the new and important features such as type extension and protected
types could not have been achieved without the introduction of additional
reserved words.
</p>
<p>
   There are some changes to the terminology in order to clarify the
exposition.  For example, reserved words are no longer formally classed
as identifiers; this has some impact on the syntax as mentioned in 1.3.
Also the term numeral is introduced in the discussion of literals.
</p>

2.2  Program Text
</a>
</h2>

<p>
As part of the original agreement between ISO and ANSI to accept
ANSI/MIL-STD-1815A as an international standard, ANSI agreed to provide
better support for international character sets in the first revision of
Ada.
</p>
<p>
   Therefore, Ada 95 uses an 8-bit character set based on ISO-8859, and a
16-bit character set based on ISO-10646.  These extended character sets
are usable in character and string literals and also in comments.
 </p>
<p>
  The text of a program (outside literals) is typically written in the
Latin-1 set, ISO-8859-1 and thereby allows accented characters in
identifiers.
</p>
<p>
   Moreover, an implementation is allowed to support other character sets
provided that it has a mode in which the "standard" sets are supported.
This enables national variations to support sets such as those used in
Japan.  See [RM95 2.1].
</p>
<p>
   In order to promote portability all implementations are required to
support a line length of at least 200 characters.
</p>

2.3  Pragmas
</a>
</h2>

<p>
In order to improve error detection when dealing with implementation
defined pragmas, we require that compilers produce a warning when a
pragma is unrecognized, and identify as an error a pragma that is
misplaced or malformed.  In Ada 83, it was permissible for compilers to
ignore such pragmas without a warning, which could lead to unexpected
behavior.
</p>
<p>
   We have formalized the definition of configuration pragmas to specify
options that affect more than a single compilation unit (often an entire
program).
</p>
<p>
   There are a number of additional pragmas in Ada 95 which will be
mentioned in the course of the discussion.

2.4  Requirements Summary
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The requirement and study topic
<pre>
     R3.1-A(4) - Extended Comment Syntax

     S3.1-A(5) - Extended Identifier Syntax
</pre>
are both addressed and met by the changes mentioned above.  Indeed,
recently approved Ada Issues permit Ada 83 compilers to meet these
requirements on a voluntary (non-binding) basis.
