<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.6">3.6 Expressions</a></H3>

An expression  is a formula that defines the computation of a value by
the application  of operators.  Six classes of operators exist in Ada.
They are listed below in increasing order of precedence:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
logical                 and or  xor
relational              =   /=  &lt;      &gt;     &lt;=       &gt;=    
binary adding           +   -   &amp;
unary adding            +   -
multiplying             &#42;   /   mod     rem
highest precedence      &#42;&#42;  abs not
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
When defining  levels of  precedence it  is very  important to  follow
common usage,  and we  found six  levels  to  be  the  minimum  number
compatible with accepted practice.
<p>
Different levels  are clearly  required for relational, binary adding,
unary adding,  multiplying, and exponentiation operators. These levels
have a  very deep  intuitive foundation, going back to algebra learned
at school.
<p>
Logical operators  must  be  on  a  different  (and  lower)  level  if
expressions such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
TODAY =  MON  or  TODAY =  SAT
LOWER_BOUND &lt;= X    and  X &lt;= UPPER_BOUND
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
are to  be written without parentheses. In the case of a succession of
operators with the same precedence, Ada adopts the traditional rule of
binding from  left to  right.  However,  the  syntax  recognizes  that
intuition of  logical operators is not as deeply rooted as in the case
of  arithmetic   operators.  For   example,  consider   the  following
expression (not allowed in Ada) written in two different ways:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
COLD and SUNNY   or   HUMID
COLD   and   SUNNY or HUMID
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Many  programmers  are  likely  to  rely  on  the  spacing  for  their
interpretation of  such expressions, whereas nobody would be fooled by
misleading spacing in the case of arithmetic operators
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X&#42;Y  +  Z                -- yes
X  &#42;  Y+Z                -- no
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
For this  reason, the syntax requires explicit parentheses in the case
of a succession of different logical operators. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
A or (B xor C)                          -- parentheses required
(A or B) xor C                          --   parentheses   required
(not always equal to previous expression)
A or (B and C)                          -- parentheses required
A or B or C -- no need for parentheses
A and B and C                           -- no need for parentheses
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Finally,  the  precedence  of  abs  is  chosen  higher  than  that  of
multiplying operators so that
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
abs A &#42; B               -- and
abs (A)     &#42; B
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
both mean  (abs A)  &#42; B. For similar reasons, the precedence of not is
higher than that of logical and relational operators so that
<p>
<PRE>    not SUNNY or WARM
</PRE><p>
is equivalent to
<p>
<pre>   (not SUNNY) or WARM
</pre>
<p>
In  practice   most  expressions  are  simple.  The  inconvenience  of
parentheses  should   not  be  exaggerated,  as  programmers  tend  to
introduce additional  parentheses anyway  for readability purposes (to
reassure themselves when in doubt) whether they are required or not.
