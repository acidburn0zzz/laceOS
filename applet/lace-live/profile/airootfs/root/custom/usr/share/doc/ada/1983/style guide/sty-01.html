<h2><BR>CHAPTER 1: Introduction</h2>

This book is intended to help the computer professional produce better Ada
programs. It presents a set of specific guidelines for using the powerful
features of Ada in a disciplined manner. Each guideline consists of a concise
statement of the principles that should be followed, and a rationale
explaining why following the guideline is important. In most cases, an example
of the use of the guideline is provided, and in some cases a further example
is included showing the consequences of violating the guideline. Possible
exceptions to the application of the guideline are explicitly noted, and
further explanatory notes, including notes on how the guideline could be
automated by a tool, are provided where appropriate. Many of the guidelines
are specific enough to be adopted as corporate or project programming
standards.  Others require a managerial decision on a particular instantiation
before they can be used as standards. In such cases, a sample instantiation is
presented and used throughout the examples. Such instantiations should be
recognized as weaker recommendations than the guidelines themselves. These
issues are discussed in <a href="sty-01-04.html#1.4">Section 1.4</a> of this introduction. Other sections of the
introduction discuss how this book should be used by various software
development personnel.
<P>
Ada was designed to support the development of high-quality, reliable,
reusable, and portable software. For a number of reasons, no programming 
language can ensure the achievement of these desirable objectives on its own. 
For example, programming must be embedded in a disciplined development process 
that addresses requirements analysis, design, implementation, verification, 
validation, and maintenance in an organized way. The use of the language must 
conform to good programming practices based on well established software 
engineering principles. This book is intended to help bridge the gap between 
these principles and the actual practice of programming in Ada. 
<P>
Clear, readable, understandable source text eases program evolution,
adaptation, and maintenance. First, such source text is more likely to be
correct and reliable. Second, effective code adaptation is a prerequisite to
code reuse, a technique that has the potential for drastic reductions in
system development cost. Easy adaptation requires a thorough understanding of
the software; this is considerably facilitated by clarity. Finally, since
maintenance (really evolution) is a costly process that continues throughout
the life of a system, clarity plays a major role in keeping maintenance costs
down. Over the entire life cycle, code has to be read and understood far more
often than it is written; the investment of writing readable, understandable
code is thus well worthwhile. Many of the guidelines in this book are designed
to promote clear source text.
<P>
There are two main aspects of code clarity: 1) Careful and consistent <i>layout</i>
of the source text on the page or the screen can enhance readability
dramatically; 2) Careful attention to the <i>structure</i> of code can make it easier
to understand. This is true both on the small scale (e.g., by careful choice
of identifier names or by disciplined use of loops) and on the large scale
(e.g., by proper use of packages). These guidelines treat both layout and
structure.
<P>
Comments in source text are a controversial issue. There are arguments both
for and against the view that comments enhance readability. The biggest
problem with comments in practice is that people often fail to update them
when the associated source text is changed, thereby making the commentary
misleading.  Commentary should be reserved for expressing needed information
that cannot be expressed in code and highlighting cases where there are
overriding reasons to violate one of the guidelines. If possible, source text
should use self-explanatory names for objects and program units; and it should
use simple, understandable program structures so that little additional
commentary is needed. The extra effort in selecting (and entering) appropriate
names and the extra thought needed to design clean and understandable program
structures are fully justified.
<P>
Programming texts often fail to discuss overall program structure; <a href="sty-04.html">Chapter 4</a> 
addresses this. The majority of the guidelines in that chapter are concerned 
with the application of sound software engineering principles such as 
information hiding and separation of concerns. The chapter is neither a 
textbook on nor an introduction to these principles; rather, it indicates how 
they can be realized using the features of Ada.
<P>
A number of other guidelines are particularly concerned with reliability and
portability issues. They counsel avoidance of language features and
programming practices that either depend on properties not defined in Ada or
on properties that may vary from implementation to implementation. Some of
these guidelines, such as the one forbidding dependence on expression
evaluation order, should never be violated. Others may have to be violated in
special situations such as interfacing to other systems. This should only be
done after careful deliberation, and such violations should be prominently
indicated. Performance constraints are often offered as an excuse for unsafe
programming practices; this is rarely a sufficient justification.
<P>
Software tools could be used to enforce, encourage, or check conformance to 
many of the guidelines. At present, such tools for Ada primarily consist of 
code formatters or syntax directed editors. Existing code formatters are often 
parameterizable and can be instantiated to lay out code in a way consistent 
with many of the guidelines in this book.
<P>
This book is intended for those involved in the actual development of software
systems written in Ada. The following subsections discuss how to make the most
effective use of the material presented. Readers with different levels of Ada
experience and different roles in a software project will need to use the book
in different ways. Specific comments to three broad categories of software
development personnel are addressed: inexperienced Ada programmers,
experienced Ada programmers, and software development managers.
