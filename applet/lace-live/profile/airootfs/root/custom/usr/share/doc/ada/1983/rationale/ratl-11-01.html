<H2>CHAPTER 11: General Program Structure - Visibility and Overloading</H2>

<H3><a name="11.1">11.1 Introduction</a></H3>

Central to  the definition  of  Ada  is  a  concern  for  the  general
structure  of   a  program,  the  rules  defining  the  visibility  of
identifiers at various points of a program, and the facilities offered
for separate  compilation. A major goal in this design was to give the
programmer precise  control over his name space: the set of names that
he may  define and  use. It  is important  to be able to introduce new
names without  having to bother about possible conflicts with existing
names. This  requires the  ability to control the inheritance of names
that are  defined in  other contexts.  As mentioned  in <a href="ratl-09.html#9">chapter 9</a>, the
notion of  package is  essential to  achieve  this  kind  of  control.
Another goal  was to provide the same visibility rules for all program
units, whether they are separately compiled or not.
<p>
The subjects  of general  program structure  and visibility  rules are
connected in  many ways  - in particular because of the possibility of
nesting program  units. They also interact with the facilities offered
for separate  compilation. This chapter will discuss program structure
and visibility  in  that  order,  and  also  the  related  subject  of
overloading.
