<P>
The language defines several kinds of entities that  are  declared,  either
explicitly or implicitly, by declarations.  Such an entity can be a numeric
literal,  an  object, a discriminant, a record component, a loop parameter,
an exception, a type, a subtype, a subprogram, a package, a  task  unit,  a
generic  unit,  a  single  entry, an entry family, a formal parameter (of a
subprogram, entry, or generic subprogram), a generic  formal  parameter,  a
named  block  or loop, a labeled statement, or an operation (in particular,
an attribute or an enumeration literal;  see <a href="lrm-03-03.html#3.3.3">3.3.3</a>). 
<P>
There are several forms of declaration.  A basic declaration is a  form  of
declaration defined as follows. 
<pre>
    basic_declaration ::=
         object_declaration     | number_declaration
       | type_declaration       | subtype_declaration
       | subprogram_declaration | package_declaration
       | task_declaration       | generic_declaration
       | exception_declaration  | generic_instantiation
       | renaming_declaration   | deferred_constant_declaration 
</pre>
<P>
Certain  forms  of declaration always occur (explicitly) as part of a basic
declaration;   these  forms  are  discriminant  specifications,   component
declarations,   entry   declarations,   parameter  specifications,  generic
parameter declarations, and enumeration  literal  specifications.   A  loop
parameter  specification  is  a  form  of  declaration  that occurs only in
certain forms of loop statement. 
<P>
The remaining forms of declaration are implicit:  the name of a block,  the
name  of  a  loop,  and a statement label are implicitly declared.  Certain
operations are implicitly declared (see <a href="lrm-03-03.html#3.3.3">3.3.3</a>).    
<P>
For each form of declaration the language rules define a certain region  of
text  called  the  scope  of  the  declaration (see <a href="lrm-08-02.html#8.2">8.2</a>).  Several forms of
declaration associate an identifier with a  declared  entity.   Within  its
scope,  and  only  there,  there are places where it is possible to use the
identifier to refer to the associated declared entity;   these  places  are
defined  by  the visibility rules (see <a href="lrm-08-03.html#8.3">8.3</a>).  At such places the identifier
is said to be a name of the entity (its simple name);  the name is said  to  
denote the associated entity. 
<P>
Certain  forms  of  enumeration literal specification associate a character
literal  with  the  corresponding  declared  entity.   Certain   forms   of
declaration  associate  an  operator  symbol or some other notation with an
explicitly or implicitly declared operation. 
<P>
The process by which a  declaration  achieves  its  effect  is  called  the
elaboration  of  the  declaration;   this  process  happens  during program
execution.                                               
<P>
After its elaboration, a declaration is said to be  elaborated.   Prior  to
the  completion  of its elaboration (including before the elaboration), the
declaration is not yet elaborated.  The elaboration of any declaration  has
always  at least the effect of achieving this change of state (from not yet
elaborated to elaborated).   The  phrase  "the  elaboration  has  no  other
effect"  is  used  in this manual whenever this change of state is the only
effect of elaboration for some form of declaration.  An elaboration process
is also defined for declarative parts, declarative items,  and  compilation 
units (see <a href="lrm-03-09.html#3.9">3.9</a> and <a href="lrm-10-05.html#10.5">10.5</a>). 
<P>
Object,  number,  type,  and  subtype declarations are described here.  The
remaining basic declarations are described in later chapters.
<P>
Note: 
<P>
The syntax rules use the term identifier for the  first  occurrence  of  an
identifier  in  some form of declaration;  the term simple name is used for
any occurrence of an identifier that already denotes some declared  entity.
