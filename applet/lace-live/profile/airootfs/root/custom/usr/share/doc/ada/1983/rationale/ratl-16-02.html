<H2>CHAPTER 16: Input-Output</H2>

<H3><a name="16.2">16.2 Basic Requirements</a></H3>

Having decided  to treat  input-output as an application area, we next
need to look at the various requirements that are imposed.
<p>
Conventional file-based  input-output  addresses  a  number  of  basic
issues. These are:
<ul>
<li>The identification  of files  from within  the program  as abstract
   entities
<p>
<li>The connection of these abstract files to real external files
<p>
<li>The control  of access  rights to  the files, so that permission to
   read or to write can be granted separately
<p>
<li>The type and format of the items to be transmitted
<p>
<li>The means of initiating actual data transfer
</ul>

A major  distinction regarding  format concerns  whether the files are
considered solely  as repositories of information for later reading by
machine, or  as the  representation of  information for  later  direct
interpretation by  the human  eye. In  the first case, the information
can conveniently  be held (externally) in a format very similar to the
internal bitwise  representation, whereas  the  second  case  requires
considerable transformation into some conventional textual format. The
two styles  are so  obviously different  that quite different packages
seem appropriate  for their  implementation. Thus  we have  a  package
TEXT_IO specifically  for the  textual format,  and in fact two rather
similar packages,  SEQUENTIAL_IO and  DIRECT_IO, for  the more general
binary input-output  - for  sequential and  for directly indexed files
respectively.
<p>
Since  Ada  is  a  typed  language,  we  need  ways  of  allowing  the
transmission of  data items  of different types without infringing the
basic rules of the type model. In the case of binary input-output, the
approach taken  is to insist that each file contains items of just one
type. This  is conveniently  done using  the generic mechanism, and so
SEQUENTIAL_IO and  DIRECT_IO are generic packages with just one formal
parameter, namely  the type  concerned. In  the case  of  TEXT_IO  the
external form  is in  all cases  a simple stream of characters, and so
there is  no problem  concerning the externally held type. Instead, we
need ways of reading and writing values of various internal types from
and to  this one  external character type; this is done by providing a
number of  overloaded procedures,  with parameters of different types,
although once again the generic mechanism is required to cope with the
variety of numeric and enumeration types, as we shall see later.
<p>
In embedded systems there is also a requirement for a much lower level
of input-output,  whereby data  is transferred  directly  to  or  from
various external devices. Because of the enormous potential generality
of devices,  it is  not possible realistically to provide a great deal
in the  way of standard facilities. The solution chosen, therefore, is
just to  provide a  simple package  LOW_LEVEL_IO  which,  in  essence,
suggests a common framework for this area.
<p>
The remainder  of this chapter considers the more important aspects of
these requirements  in more detail, with especial emphasis on how they
are met through the use of various normal features of Ada.
