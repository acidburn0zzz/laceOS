Strong typing promotes reliability in software. The type definition of an 
object defines all legal values and operations and allows the compiler to 
check for and identify potential errors during compilation. In addition, the 
rules of type allow the compiler to generate code to check for violations of 
type constraints at execution time. Using these Ada compiler's features 
facilitates earlier and more complete error detection than that which is 
available with less strongly typed languages.

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Limit the range of scalar types as much as possible. 
<li>Seek information about possible values from the application. 
<li>Do not overload any of the type names in package Standard. 
<li>Use subtype declarations to improve program readability (Booch 1987). 
<li>Use derived types and subtypes in concert (see <a href="sty-05-03.html#5.3.1">Guideline 5.3.1</a>). 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>subtype Card_Image is String (1 .. 80);

Input_Line : Card_Image := (others =&gt; ' ');

-- restricted integer type: 
type    Day_Of_Leap_Year     is                  range 1 .. 366; 
subtype Day_Of_Non_Leap_Year is Day_Of_Leap_Year range 1 .. 365;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
By the following declaration, the programmer means, &quot;I haven't the foggiest 
idea how many,&quot; but the actual range will show up buried in the code or as a  system parameter:<P>
<IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>Employee_Count : Integer;</CODE>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Eliminating meaningless values from the legal range improves the compiler's  
ability to detect errors when an object is set to an invalid value. This also  
improves program readability. In addition, it forces you to carefully think  
about each use of objects declared to be of the subtype.<P>
Different implementations provide different sets of values for most of the  
predefined types. A reader cannot determine the intended range from the  
predefined names. This situation is aggravated when the predefined names are  
overloaded.<P>
The names of an object and its subtype can clarify their intended use and  
document low-level design decisions. The example above documents a design 
decision to restrict the software to devices whose physical parameters are  
derived from the characteristics of punch cards. This information is easy to  
find for any later changes, thus enhancing program maintainability.<P>
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-08-05.html#8.5">Section 8.5 of the Ada Language Reference Manual</a> says that declaring a subtype  
without a constraint is one method for renaming a type.<P>
Types can have highly constrained sets of values without eliminating useful  
values. Usage as described in <a href="sty-05-03.html#5.3.1">Guideline 5.3.1</a> eliminates many flag variables and  
type conversions within executable statements. This renders the program more  
readable while allowing the compiler to enforce strong typing constraints.

<H4>note</H4>
Subtype declarations do not define new types, only constraints for existing  
types.<P>
Recognize that any deviation from this guideline detracts from the advantages  
of the strong typing facilities of the Ada language.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use enumeration types instead of numeric codes.  
<li>Use representation clauses to match requirements of external devices. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
Use
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Color is (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow);</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
rather than
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Blue   : constant := 1; 
Red    : constant := 2; 
Green  : constant := 3; 
Yellow : constant := 4;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
and add the following if necessary.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>for Color use (Blue   =&gt; 1, 
               Red    =&gt; 2, 
               Green  =&gt; 3, 
               Yellow =&gt; 4);</pre></td></tr></table>


<H4>rationale</H4>
Enumerations are more robust than numeric codes; they leave less potential for  
errors resulting from incorrect interpretation and from additions to and  
deletions from the set of values during maintenance. Numeric codes are  
holdovers from languages that have no user-defined types.<P>
In addition, Ada provides a number of attributes (<CODE>'Pos</CODE>, <CODE>'Val</CODE>, <CODE>'Succ</CODE>, <CODE>'Pred</CODE>,  
<CODE>'Image</CODE>, and <CODE>'Value</CODE>) for enumeration types which, when used, are more reliable  
than user-written operations on encodings.<P>
A numeric code may at first seem appropriate to match external values.   
Instead, these situations call for a representation clause on the enumeration  
type. The representation clause documents the &quot;encoding.&quot; If the program is 
properly structured to isolate and encapsulate hardware dependencies (see  
<a href="sty-07-01.html#7.1.5">Guideline 7.1.5</a>), the numeric code ends up in an interface package where it can be  
easily found and replaced should the requirements change.<P>
