<H2>CHAPTER 12: Generic Units</H2>

<H3><a name="12.2">12.2 Informal Presentation of Generic Units</a></H3>

A generic unit is a program unit: it is either a generic subprogram or
a generic  package. The  declaration of  a generic  unit starts with a
generic formal  part which  defines  compilation-time  generic  formal
parameters; the  generic formal  part  is  followed  by  a  subprogram
declaration (for  a generic  subprogram) or  by a  package declaration
(for a generic package).
<p>
A generic  subprogram is  not an  ordinary subprogram:  for example it
cannot  be  called;  it  is  rather  a  template  for  all  (ordinary)
subprograms that  can  be  obtained  by  associating  specific  actual
parameters with  the generic  formal parameters.  Similarly a  generic
package is a template for (ordinary) packages.
<p>
A specific  program unit  that corresponds  to  a  given  template  is
created by  a declaration called a generic instantiation. This has the
effect of  creating a named instance. In the case of a subprogram, for
example, this  named instance  can then  be called  in the  usual way.
Thus,  apart   from  parameterization,   generic  declaration  is  for
nongeneric program units what a type declaration is for data objects:

<H3><BR><a name="12.2.1">12.2.1 Generic Formal Parts</a></H3>

A generic  formal part  starts with  the  reserved  word  generic  and
includes declarations  of generic  formal  parameters.  These  can  be
formal objects  (variables and constants, as in the case of parameters
of subprograms);  but they  can also be generic formal subprograms and
generic formal types. For example, the generic formal part
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ITEM is private;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
declares the  generic formal  type ITEM.  We find  this generic formal
part in the declaration of the following generic procedure:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ITEM is private;
procedure EXCHANGE(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out ITEM);

procedure EXCHANGE(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out ITEM) is
  OLD_LEFT :  constant ITEM  :=  LEFT;
begin
  LEFT   :=  RIGHT;
  RIGHT :=  OLD_LEFT;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In this example, LEFT and RIGHT are the ordinary (that is, nongeneric)
parameters: each  procedure obtained by instantiation of this template
will have  these parameters, which are subject to dynamic replacement.
In contrast,  the type  ITEM given  in the  generic formal  part is  a
generic formal parameter which is to be substituted for at compilation
time. This  generic parameter  may appear  in the  body of the generic
subprogram; here  it is  used  in  the  declaration  of  the  constant
OLD_LEFT.

<H3><BR><a name="12.2.2">12.2.2 Generic Instantiations</a></H3>

A generic  instantiation creates  an instance  of a  generic  unit  by
replacement of  the generic  parameters. A  generic instantiation is a
declaration and  it associates a name with the corresponding instance.
Usually, there  will be  several different  instantiations of  a given
generic unit:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SWAP_INT is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  INTEGER);
procedure SWAP_CHAR   is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  CHARACTER);
procedure SWAP_COLOR  is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  COLOR);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Each resultant  program unit  is an  ordinary procedure, applicable to
actual parameters  of the  corresponding type. The resulting procedure
specifications are as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SWAP_INT (LEFT, RIGHT :  in out INTEGER);
procedure SWAP_CHAR   (LEFT, RIGHT :  in out CHARACTER);
procedure SWAP_COLOR  (LEFT, RIGHT :  in out COLOR);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In each  case, the  name of the generic procedure has been replaced by
the name  given in  the instantiation,  the formal  type by the actual
type, and  everything else  remains the  same - the names and modes of
the formal  parameters of  the instantiation  are the same as those of
the generic procedure.
<p>
The fact  that these  procedures are obtained by generic instantiation
does not preclude overloading of their names:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  INTEGER);
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  CHARACTER);
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(ITEM =&gt;  COLOR);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Calls of these procedures will be as usual; for example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SWAP(I, J);             -- for integers
SWAP(SHADE, TINT);          -- for colors
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In general, a generic instantiation for a procedure has the form
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure identifier is
  new name [(generic_association {, generic_association})];
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The syntax  of generic  associations is  similar to  that of parameter
associations for  subprogram calls.  Note that both named associations
and positional  associations are possible, as usual. Thus our previous
example can be written equivalently in positional form as:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(INTEGER);
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(CHARACTER);
procedure SWAP is new EXCHANGE(COLOR);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A program  unit obtained  by generic  instantiation can be viewed as a
copy of the corresponding generic unit where each formal parameter has
been replaced  by the corresponding actual parameter. For example, the
declaration of SWAP_INT produces a procedure equivalent to
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure SWAP_INT(LEFT, RIGHT :  in out INTEGER) is
  OLD_LEFT :  constant INTEGER  :=  LEFT;
begin
  LEFT    :=  RIGHT;
  RIGHT :=  OLD_LEFT;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A generic  instantiation need  not appear in the same declarative part
as the  corresponding generic declaration - it may appear at any point
where the name of the generic unit is visible.
<p>
The rule  followed for  the identification  of names  within a generic
unit  is   similar  to   that  used  for  subprograms:  All  non-local
identifiers of  the body  of a  generic unit  are  identified  in  the
context of the generic declaration. In contrast, the actual parameters
given in  the generic  associations must be interpreted in the context
of the generic instantiation.
<p>
Note that this rule differs from a simple textual substitution. In the
latter case  all  identifiers,  including  non-local  ones,  would  be
interpreted in the context of the instantiation. Hence it would not be
possible in general to obtain the effect of generic program units by a
simple (context-free)  macro facility;  and this  was our  reason  for
referring  to   context-sensitive  macro  expansion,  earlier  in  the
introduction.
<p>
To summarize,  the generic  parameter names  (and the name of the unit
itself) are  the only  unresolved identifiers in the body of a generic
program unit.  For any  generic instantiation,  replacements  must  be
provided for  all generic  parameters. These  replacements are  to  be
interpreted in the context of the instantiation.

<H3><BR><a name="12.2.3">12.2.3 Private Types as Generic Formal Types</a></H3>

In  the   simple  EXCHANGE  example  presented  so  far,  very  little
information is  needed about  the type  given as  a generic parameter:
within the  body of this generic procedure, the only operation assumed
available for  objects of  the type is assignment. Hence this template
can be applied to any type for which assignment is available; that is,
to any type except a limited type.
<p>
In general  when a  generic formal type is specified as being private,
no operations  are assumed  to be available aside from assignment, the
predefined  comparison   for  equality  and  inequality,  and  certain
attributes such  as SIZE.  Furthermore, if  the generic formal type is
declared  as  limited  private,  then  not  even  assignment  and  the
comparison for equality and inequality are available.
<p>
For such  types - whether limited or not - each operation that is used
within the  generic body  must be  specified by another generic formal
parameter,  namely,  a  generic  formal  subprogram.  As  an  example,
consider the generic function:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is limited private;
  with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM;
function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM;

function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM is
begin
  return X &#42; X;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Since nothing  is known  a priori about the type ELEM, it would not be
possible to  write X &#42; X if the specification of "&#42;" were not provided
explicitly by  a  generic  formal  parameter  (this  specification  is
prefixed by  the reserved  word with  to distinguish  it syntactically
from the generic function itself and thus to show that we are still in
the generic formal part):
<p>
<PRE>    with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM;</PRE>
<p>
Instances of  SQUARING are  created  by  supplying  the  corresponding
actual parameters. For example, for the instantiation
<p>
<PRE>    function SQUARE is new SQUARING(INTEGER, "&#42;");</PRE>
<p>
the operation "&#42;" used in the body is the operation defined as
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER) return INTEGER;</PRE>
<p>
that  is,   the  normal   integer  multiplication.  Thus  the  generic
instantiation produces a function body equivalent to the following:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function SQUARE(X :  INTEGER) return INTEGER is
begin
  return X &#42; X;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Of course, other instantiations are possible. For example, we may want
to use  SQUARING for  matrices, to  extend the  existing component-by-
component multiplication
<p>
<PRE>    function MULT(X, Y :  MATRIX) return MATRIX;</PRE>
<p>
Thus with the generic instantiation
<p>
<PRE>    function SQUARE is new SQUARING(ELEM =&gt;  MATRIX,  "&#42;" =&gt;  MULT);</PRE>
<p>
we obtain  a function that performs component-by-component squaring of
a matrix.

<H3><BR><a name="12.2.4">12.2.4 Other Forms of Generic Formal Types</a></H3>

Types are by far the most useful form of generic formal parameter. For
this reason, the language provides (beyond formal private types) forms
of formal type that correspond to major families of types in Ada. Many
of these  formal types  appear as  type patterns  formed with  the box
symbol. For example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type BASE   is (&lt;&gt;);            -- discrete
type INT is range &lt;&gt;;           -- integer
type FIXED  is delta &lt;&gt;;             -- fixed point
type MASS   is digits &lt;&gt;;            -- floating point
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In each  case, the  box symbolizes  what is  not there,  what is  left
unspecified. So  for example,  the type INT will stand for any integer
type, with  any possible  range; the  type BASE  will  stand  for  any
discrete type, whether an enumeration or an integer type.
<p>
Each formal  type specifies minimum requirements for the corresponding
actual types,  and the  specification and body of the generic unit can
rely on these minimal assumptions. For example, for a formal type such
as BASE,  we can  count on  the  availability  of  all  properties  of
discrete types:
<ul>
<li>assignment:&nbsp;&nbsp;:=

<li>comparison for equality and inequality:&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;/=

<li>ordering relations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;=

<li>attributes:&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST, LAST, SUCC, PRED, ...

<li>use for array indexing
</ul>

Similarly for  a  formal  type  such  as  INT  we  can  count  on  the
availability of  all properties  of discrete  types, and  also on  the
additional properties of integer types:
<ul>
<li>binary adding operators:&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;-

<li>unary adding operators:&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;-

<li>multiplying operators:&nbsp;&nbsp;&#42;&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;&nbsp;mod&nbsp;&nbsp;rem

<li>highest precedence operators:&nbsp;&nbsp;&#42;&#42;&nbsp;&nbsp;abs
</ul>

For a  given instantiation,  the actual  type will have to satisfy the
minimum  requirements   established  by  the  formal  type.  Thus  any
enumeration type and any integer type will match the formal type BASE;
on the other hand, only an integer type will match the formal type INT
(not an enumeration type).
<p>
As an  example, consider  the treatment  of sets.  In <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>, sets are
dealt with  by means of a specific language feature. In Ada a specific
feature is unnecessary since sets can be defined by a generic package:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type BASE is (&lt;&gt;);      -- any discrete type
package ON_SETS is
  type SET is array (BASE) of BOOLEAN;

  EMPTY :  constant SET :=  (BASE =&gt;  FALSE);
  FULL   :  constant SET :=  (BASE =&gt;  TRUE);

  type SEQUENCE is array (POSITIVE range &lt;&gt;) of BASE;

  function SET_OF(S :  SEQUENCE) return SET;
  function "+" (LEFT :  SET;  RIGHT :  SET)         return SET; -- set union
  function "+" (LEFT :  SET;  RIGHT :  BASE)    return SET;     -- element insertion
  -- other set operations:
end ON_SETS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The declaration of the formal type BASE requires the actual type to be
discrete and  we are  clearly using this assumption when using BASE as
index subtype  for the  type SET;  and similarly  when using BASE as a
choice for the aggregates that give the values of EMPTY and FULL.
<p>
We can  now use ordinary set operations with a chosen discrete type by
instantiation  of   this  generic   package.  For   example,  for  the
enumeration type:
<p>
<PRE>    type DAY is (MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN);</PRE>
<p>
we can create the instance
<p>
<PRE>    package DAY_SETS is new ON_SETS(BASE =&gt;  DAY);</PRE>
<p>
and then
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
use DAY_SETS;
S :  SET;
...
S :=  SET_OF((SUN, TUE, WED));
S :=  S + SAT;
...
S :=  S + SET_OF((MON, THU));
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The actual  parameter of  SET_OF is a SEQUENCE - an array of values of
the base  type, indexed  by the positive numbers 1, 2, and 3 - and the
function constructs  the corresponding  set. The  next statements then
use set addition. A sketch of the generic body is given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package body ON_SETS is
  ...
  function SET_OF(S :  SEQUENCE) return SET is
    RESULT :  SET :=  EMPTY;
  begin
    for N in S'RANGE loop
      RESULT(S(N)) :=  TRUE;
    end loop;
    return RESULT;
  end;

  function "+" (LEFT :  SET;  RIGHT :  SET) return SET is
  begin
    return LEFT or RIGHT;
  end;

  function "+" (LEFT :  SET;  RIGHT :  BASE) return SET is
    RESULT :  SET :=  LEFT;
  begin
    RESULT(RIGHT) :=  TRUE;
    return RESULT;
  end;
  ...
end ON_SETS;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On top  of these  type patterns with boxes we can construct other type
patterns  by   means  of   array  type  definitions  and  access  type
definitions.  For  example,  a  generic  sorting  procedure  could  be
specified as:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ITEM   is private;
  type INDEX  is (&lt;&gt;);
  type ROW     is array (INDEX range &lt;&gt;) of ITEM;
  with function "&lt;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ITEM) return BOOLEAN;
procedure SORT(R :  in out ROW);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
An  instantiation   would  have   to  meet  the  minimum  requirements
established by this generic formal part. For example, consider:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type MEETING  is ...             -- some record type
type AGENDA   is array (DAY range &lt;&gt;) of MEETING;
function LESS_IMPORTANT(X, Y :  MEETING) return BOOLEAN;

procedure ORDER is
  new SORT(ITEM   =&gt;  MEETING,
          INDEX =&gt;  DAY,
          ROW    =&gt;  AGENDA,
          "&lt;"       =&gt;  LESS_IMPORTANT);

MY_WEEK :  AGENDA(MON .. FRI);
  ...
ORDER(MY_WEEK);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The  matching   types  are   clearly  shown  by  the  named  parameter
associations. Consider  for example  the definition of the formal type
ROW:
<p>
<PRE>    array (INDEX range &lt;&gt;) of ITEM;</PRE>
<p>
After replacing  ITEM by MEETING, and INDEX by DAY, we obtain the type
definition
<p>
<PRE>    array (DAY range &lt;&gt;) of MEETING;</PRE>
<p>
which is exactly the way AGENDA is defined, so that AGENDA matches ROW
correctly. Similarly, the function LESS_IMPORTANT matches the operator
"&lt;", once we have replaced ITEM by MEETING.
<p>
The types  used in  this example  are certainly not the usual types we
find in  ordinary programming, and yet the instantiation works because
we have  limited our  required assumptions  to the minimum. We did not
assume anything about ITEM, apart from the ability to assign, which is
needed for  sorting; the  only assumption that we made about the index
type was  that it  was discrete  (assuming an  integer type would have
been overspecification);  finally we assumed the existence of an order
relation for  ITEMS. Had  we assumed more than is strictly needed (for
example, real  items, integer  indices) the  instantiation would  have
failed.

<H3><BR><a name="12.2.5">12.2.5 Default Parameters</a></H3>

Default  values  can  be  defined  for  generic  parameters  that  are
subprograms. Thus an alternative form of definition for SQUARING might
be
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type ELEM is private;
  with function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  ELEM) return ELEM is &lt;&gt;;
function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM;

function SQUARING(X :  ELEM) return ELEM is
begin
  return X &#42; X;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The specification  of the formal function "&#42;" indicates, by means of a
box, that  a corresponding  actual parameter  need not  be present  in
instantiations of  the generic  function SQUARING. For example, we can
write:
<p>
<PRE>    function SQUARE is new SQUARING(INTEGER);</PRE>
<p>
As usual,  the box  stands for  what is missing - in this case it is a
function whose specification is obtained by replacing ELEM by INTEGER:
<p>
<PRE>    function "&#42;" (LEFT, RIGHT :  INTEGER) return INTEGER;</PRE>
<p>
and since  there is  such an  operation for  the  type  INTEGER,  this
integer multiplication  is used  - by default - in place of the actual
parameter.
<p>
This form of default corresponds to very good programming practice: We
have a natural notation, such as "&#42;" for multiplication, and we expect
users to  make natural  use of  this notation.  With this  form we can
specify the  box  for  the  corresponding  formal  parameter  so  that
instantiations will select by default the "natural" operation.
<p>
Naturally, we can always override the default by providing an explicit
actual parameter:
<p>
<PRE>    function SQUARE is new SQUARING(ELEM =&gt;  MATRIX,  "&#42;" =&gt;  MULT);</PRE>
<p>
There is  another form  of default,  which names  the  default  actual
subprogram; for example:
<p>
<PRE>    with procedure STEP(X :  in out INTEGER) is INCREMENT;</PRE>
<p>
where the  procedure INCREMENT  is a procedure visible at the place of
the formal  parameter declaration,  and whose  profile matches that of
the formal procedure:
<p>
<PRE>    procedure INCREMENT(N :  in out INTEGER);</PRE>
<p>
For this  second form  of default, the actual parameter is to be found
in the  context of the generic declaration, whereas in the case of the
box, the  default was  to be  found in  the  context  of  the  generic
instantiation.
