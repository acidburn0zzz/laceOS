<DIV Class="paranum">4.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>The principle here is that 
a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-6-3.html#S0162">subprogram_body</A></SPAN>

<DIV Class="paranum">5.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>For example, if package declarations 
A and B both say &ldquo;<B>with</B> X;&rdquo;, and the user compiles 
a compilation unit that says &ldquo;<B>with</B> A, B;&rdquo;, then the

<DIV Class="paranum">5.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>What it means to be a &ldquo;different 
version&rdquo; is not specified by the language. In some implementations, 
it means that the compilation unit has been recompiled. In others, it 
means that the source of the compilation unit has been edited in some 
significant way.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note that an implementation cannot require the 
existence of compilation units upon which the given one does not semantically 
depend. For example, an implementation is required to be able to compile 
a compilation unit that says &quot;<B>with</B> A;&quot; when A's body 
does not exist. It has to be able to detect errors without looking at 
A's body.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">5.d</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Similarly, the implementation has to be able 
to compile a call to a subprogram for which a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN>

When a compilation unit that declares or renames a library unit is added 
to the environment, the implementation may remove from the environment 
any preexisting <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-10-1-1.html#S0230">library_item</A></SPAN>

same <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-6-1.html#S0154">defining_program_unit_name</A></SPAN></SPAN>. 
When a compilation unit that is a subunit or the body of a library unit 
is added to the environment, the implementation may remove from the environment 
any preexisting version of the same compilation unit. <SPAN class="insert2">When 
a compilation unit that contains a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-10-1-3.html#S0240">body_stub</A></SPAN>

When a given compilation unit is removed from the environment, the implementation 
may also remove any compilation unit that depends semantically upon the 
given one. If the given compilation unit contains the body of a subprogram 
to which a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Inline applies, the implementation may also remove any compilation unit 
containing a call to that subprogram.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Ramification:&nbsp;</B>The permissions given in 
this paragraph correspond to the traditional model, where compilation 
units enter the environment by being compiled into it, and the compiler 
checks their legality at that time. A implementation model in which the 
environment consists of all source files in a given directory might not 
want to take advantage of these permissions. Compilation units would 
not be checked for legality as soon as they enter the environment; legality 
checking would happen later, when compilation units are compiled. In 
this model, compilation units might never be automatically removed from 
the environment; they would be removed when the user explicitly deletes 
a source file.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note that the rule is recursive: if the above 
permission is used to remove a compilation unit containing an inlined 
subprogram call, then compilation units that depend semantically upon 
the removed one may also be removed, and so on.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note that here we are talking about dependences 
among existing compilation units in the environment; it doesn't matter 
what <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-10-1-2.html#S0237">with_clause</A></SPAN>s 
are attached to the new compilation unit that triggered all this.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">7.d</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">An implementation may have other modes in which 
compilation units in addition to the ones mentioned above are removed. 
For example, an implementation might inline subprogram calls without 
an explicit <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Inline. If so, it either has to have a mode in which that optimization 
is turned off, or it has to automatically regenerate code for the inlined 
calls without requiring the user to resubmit them to the compiler.&nbsp;</DIV>

If multiple libraries are supported, the implementation has to define 
how a single environment is constructed when a compilation unit is submitted

resolved by treating each library as the root of a hierarchy of child 
library units. <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%">{<I>program library: See

without forcing all of the compilation units that semantically depend 
on the compilation unit containing the instantiation to be recompiled.
