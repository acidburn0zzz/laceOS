<h1>
8   Visibility Rules
</h1>

<p>
This is an area of the language which is largely ignored by the normal
programmer except when it produces surprising or frustrating
consequences.  The changes have thus been directed largely towards making
the rules clear and consistent and with more helpful consequences.  The
changes are
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    The visibility and scope rules are rewritten to make them consistent
     and clearer.  They also incorporate the consequences of the
     introduction of the hierarchical library.
<li>
    The use type clause is introduced for operators.
<li>
    Renaming is now allowed for subprogram bodies, generic units and
     library units.
<li>
    There are also a number of minor improvements such as the preference
     rules for overload resolution.
</ul>

<h2>
<a name=1>
8.1  Scope and Visibility
</a>
</h2>

<p>
This is an area where there is no substitute for a precise description of
the rules.  Suffice it to say that the rules for Ada 83 were obscure and
probably not truly understood by anybody; a consequence was subtle
variation between compilers to the detriment of portability.  We will not
attempt to summarize the 95 rules but refer the reader to [RM95] for the
details.
</p>
<p>
   One important change is that character literals are now treated like
other literals with regard to visibility.  This means that they are
always visible although the legality of their use will depend upon the
context.  So
<pre>
   package P is
      type Roman_Digit is ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M');
   end P;

   with P;
   package Q is
   ...
      Five: constant P.Roman_Digit := 'V';
   ...
   end Q;
</pre>
is allowed in Ada 95 although in Ada 83 we would have had to write P.'V'
or alternatively supplied a use clause for P.
</p>
<p>
   The visibility rules now also take account of the introduction of
child packages.  Most of the changes are straightforward but there is one
interesting interaction with subunits.  Consider
<pre>
   package P is
      ...
   end P;

   package P.Q is
      ...
   end P.Q;

   package body P is
      Q: Integer;  -- legal
      procedure Sub is separate;
   end P;

   with P.Q;       -- illegal
   separate(P)
   procedure Sub is
      ...
   end Sub;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The declaration of Q in the body of P is permitted because the body does
not have a with clause for P.Q.  But the with clause makes the subunit
illegal because it could otherwise see both P.Q the child package and P.Q
the variable in the body, and they are not overloadable.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=2>
8.2  Use Clauses
</a>
</h2>

<p>
As mentioned in Part One the use of operators in Ada 83 caused problems.
Many groups of users recognized that the use clause could make programs
hard to understand because the origin of identifiers became obscure.
Accordingly many organizations banned use clauses.  This meant that
either operators of user defined types had to be called with prefix
notation such as Complex."+"(P, Q) or else had to be locally renamed.
</p>
<p>
   This difficulty also occurred with predefined operators.  Thus given
an access type T declared in a package P, it was very annoying to find
that one could not write
<pre>
   with P;
   procedure Q is
      X: P.T;
   begin
      ...
      if X /= null then
      ...
   end Q;
</pre>
but had to provide a use clause for P or a renaming for "=" or write the
diabolical
<pre>
   if P."/="(X, null) then
</pre>
</p>
<p>
   This problem is overcome in Ada 95 by the introduction of the use type
clause which just provides visibility of the operators of a type and
thereby allows them to be used in the natural infixed form.  This ensures
that a use package clause is not needed and hence the full name is still
required for other identifiers.
</p>
<p>
   The introduction of child units causes some extension to the rules for
packages.  As explained in Chapter 10, child units are treated like
separately compiled but logically nested units.  Like nested units, the
name of a child mentioned in a with clause becomes directly visible when
the logically enclosing parent package is specified in a use clause.
</p>
<p>
   And so, using the example from II.8
<pre>
   with OS.File_Manager;
   procedure Hello is
      use OS;  -- makes File_Manager directly visible
               -- as well as other declarations in package OS
      File: File_Descriptor :=
              File_Manager.Open("Hello.Txt", File_Manager.Write_Only);
   begin
      File_Manager.Write(File, "Hello world.");
      File_Manager.Close(File);
   end Hello;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
<a name=3>
8.3  Renaming
</a>
</h2>

<p>
To enhance the usefulness of renaming, the body of a subprogram may be
provided by a renaming declaration.
</p>
<p>
   If the subprogram declaration is in a package specification while the
subprogram definition via a renaming is in a package body, the renaming
must be of a subprogram that has subtype conformance (see 6.2) with the
subprogram's declaration.  This ensures that the caller of the subprogram
will perform the correct constraint checks on the actual parameters, and
pass the parameters following the correct calling convention seeing only
the subprogram's specification.
</p>
<p>
   A normal subprogram renaming requires only mode conformance. This kind
of conformance is too weak for a renaming provided in the body.  Given
only mode conformance, the caller might perform constraint checks that
were too stringent or too lax, and might pass parameters following the
wrong calling conventions, putting them in the wrong place on the stack,
or in the wrong register.
</p>
<p>
   We considered requiring subtype conformance for all subprogram
renaming.  However, this introduces upward incompatibilities,
particularly given the existing equivalence between generic formal
subprogram matching and renaming.  Furthermore, it is not always possible
to statically match the subtype of a formal parameter of a subprogram, if
the subprogram is implicitly declared as part of the type definition.  In
particular, if the subprogram is derived from a parent type, then the
formal parameter subtypes have the constraints that were present on the
parent type's subprogram.  If the derived type definition itself imposes
a constraint, then it is likely that the constraint on the formal
parameter of the derived subprogram is actually looser than the
constraint on the first subtype of the derived type.  This means there is
no nameable subtype that has constraints as loose as those on the formal
parameter.
</p>
<p>
   In the case of a primitive operation of a tagged type, renaming will
cause a new slot in the dispatch table to be created if the renaming is
itself primitive (that is in the same package specification as the type).
If the original primitive operation is overridden then the renamed view
will naturally depend upon whether renaming occurs before or after the
overriding.  Consider
<pre>
   package P is
      type T is tagged ...;
      function Predefined_Equal(X, Y: T) return Boolean renames "=";
      function "="(X, Y: T) return Boolean:  -- overrides
      function User_Defined_Equal(X, Y: T) return Boolean renames "=";
   end P;
</pre>
where we have renamed the predefined equality both before and after
overriding it.  Both renamings create new slots which are then
initialized with the current meaning of equality.  That for
Predefined_Equal thus refers to the predefined equal whereas that for
User_Defined_Equal refers to the overridden version.  The consequence is
that renaming can be used to hang on to an old primitive operation
irrespective of whether that old operation is subsequently overridden.
Such a renaming is itself a distinct primitive operation which could
later be overridden for any subsequently derived type.
</p>
<p>
   On the other hand a renaming which is not a primitive operation will
not create a new slot but will simply refer to the operation at the point
of the renaming.  Thus if User_Defined_Equal is declared in a distinct
package Q (after P), then it will not be primitive but will still refer
to the overridden operation.  This will occur even if the overriding is
in the private part and thus not visible to Q.  For a further discussion
see [AARM 8.5.4].
</p>
<p>
   This ability of renaming to create a new slot may be considered
surprising because the general purpose of renaming is simply to create a
new name for an existing entity; but there is of course no new entity
being created but just a different way of accessing an existing entity.
</p>
<p>
   Another very useful change is the ability to rename a library unit as
a library unit.  (It was possible to rename a library unit in Ada 83 but
only as a local unit.)  Library unit renaming is particularly important
with the hierarchical library; this is discussed in detail in 10.1.2.
</p>
<p>
   A related change is the ability to rename a generic unit.  Curiously
enough this was not permitted in Ada 83 although most other entities
could be renamed.  Thus we can write
<pre>
   generic package Enum_IO renames Ada.Text_IO.Enumeration_IO;
</pre>
as mentioned in [RM95 8.5.5].
</p>
<p>
   In order to prevent difficulties with generic children, a child of a
generic parent (such a child must be generic) can only be renamed if the
renaming occurs inside the declarative region of its parent; it could be
renamed as a child.  This is consistent with the rules regarding the
instantiation of such generic child units mentioned in II.8.
</p>

<h2>
<a name=4>
8.4  Other Improvements
</a>
</h2>

<p>
The overload resolution rules of Ada 83 were confusing and unclear and
this section of the reference manual has been completely rewritten.
</p>
<p>
   An important new rule is the preference rule for operators and ranges
of root numeric types (see 3.3).  Briefly this says that an ambiguity can
be resolved by preferring the operator of the root type.  This rule
coupled with automatic conversion from a universal type removes the need
for the special rules in Ada 83 regarding universal convertible operands.
</p>
<p>
   As an example, consider
<pre>
   C: constant := 2 + 3;
</pre>
which was allowed in Ada 83 because the expression was required to be
universal and so no question of ambiguity arose.  It is not ambiguous in
Ada 95 either but for different reasons; the expression 2 + 3 is
considered to be of type root_integer (it could otherwise be Integer or
Long_Integer).  The root_integer is then converted implicitly to
universal_integer as required for the initial value.
</p>
<p>
   The special rule regarding ranges in loops and for array indexes
(which are in the distinct syntactic category
discrete_subtype_definition) which result in them by treated as of type
Integer if no specific subtype mark is specified is changed in Ada 95.
The new rule is that if the range resolves to be of the type root_integer
then it is taken to be of type Integer.
</p>
<p>
   One outcome of all this is that we can now write
<pre>
   for I in -1 .. 100 loop
</pre>
as we have already mentioned in Part One.  The interpretation is that -1
resolves to root_integer because of the preference rules and then the
special rule just mentioned is used so that the range is finally treated
as of type Integer.
</p>

8.5  Requirements Summary
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Many of the changes in this area of the language are aimed at making the
language more precise and easier to understand as requested by the
general requirement
<pre>
     R2.2-B(1) - Understandability
</pre>
and we note in particular that the example in [DoD 90 A.2.3] concerning
visibility of literals and operations has been addressed and satisfied.
</p>
<p>
   The related requirement
<pre>
     R2.2-C(1) - Minimize Special Case Restrictions
</pre>
discussed in [DoD 90 A.3.12] contains the example of negative literals in
loops which has also been satisfied.
</p>
<p>
   The requirement
<pre>
     R2.2-A(1) - Reduce Deterrents to Efficiency
</pre>
is addressed by the elimination of the problem of returning task objects
explicitly mentioned in the requirement in [DoD 90].
