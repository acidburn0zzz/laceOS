<P>
Compilers are required to enforce the language rules in the same manner for
a  program  consisting of several compilation units (and subunits) as for a
program submitted as a single compilation.  Consequently,  a  library  file
containing information on the compilation units of the program library must
be  maintained  by the compiler or compiling environment.  This information
may include symbol tables and other information  pertaining to the order of
previous compilations. 
<P>
A normal submission to the compiler consists of the compilation unit(s) and
the library file.  The latter is used for checks and is  updated  for  each
compilation unit successfully compiled. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
A  single  program  library  is  implied  for  the  compilation  units of a
compilation.  The possible existence of different program libraries and the
means by which they are named are not concerns of the language  definition;
they are concerns of the programming environment. 
<P>
There  should  be  commands  for  creating  the  program library of a given
program or of a given family of programs.  These commands  may  permit  the
reuse  of  units  of  other  program  libraries.   Finally, there should be
commands for interrogating the status of the units of  a  program  library.
The form of these commands is not specified by the language definition. 
<P>
