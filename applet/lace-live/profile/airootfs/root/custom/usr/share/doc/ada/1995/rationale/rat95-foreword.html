<h1>
Foreword
</h1>

<p>
I am delighted to write these words of introduction to this
important document which accompanies the new Ada
International Standard.  It is most satisfying to see the
efforts of all those involved with the language revision
effort bearing fruit, and I am very confident that Ada 95
will prove to be a worthy successor to Ada 83, extending
Ada's Software Engineering advantages to new user
communities.  With modern features such as Object-Oriented
Programming and enhanced interfacing capabilities, Ada 95
will enable the flexible and reliable development of major
applications in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
The new standard, officially ISO/IEC 8652:1995, thus
marks an important milestone in Ada's history.  Enormous
contributions from some of the world's finest software
engineers and programming language experts have gone into
the revision effort, reflecting both current and anticipated
user requirements.  I would therefore like to take this
opportunity to acknowledge the sterling efforts of all those
involved in developing the new standard and in writing this
rationale document.
</p>
<p>
   The Ada 95 language revision was prepared by the Ada 9X
Design Team based at Intermetrics, Inc., under the direction
of William Carlson, Program Manager, and S. Tucker Taft,
Technical Director.  The Intermetrics team included Robert
Duff (Oak Tree Software) and also consultants John Barnes,
Ben Brosgol, and Offer Pazy.
</p>
<p>
   A team led by John Goodenough (SEI) prepared the
technical requirements specification for the Ada revision,
based on preliminary work by the Institute for Defense
Analyses under Audrey Hook to analyze the more than 750
revision requests submitted by the Ada community.
</p>
<p>
The following consultants to the Ada 9X Project
contributed to the Specialized Needs Annexes:  Ted Baker
(SEI, Florida State Univ.), Ken Dritz (Argonne National
Laboratory), Anthony Gargaro (Computer Sciences Corp.), John
Goodenough (SEI), John McHugh (consultant), and Brian
Wichmann (NPL: UK).
</p>
<p>
   This work was regularly reviewed by the Ada 9X
Distinguished Reviewers and the members of the ISO Ada 9X
Rapporteur Group (XRG):  Erhard Ploedereder, Chairman of DRs
and XRG (University of Stuttgart: Germany); B. Bardin
(Hughes); J. Barnes (consultant: UK); B. Brett (DEC);
B. Brosgol (consultant); R. Brukardt (RR Software); N. Cohen
(IBM); R. Dewar (NYU); G. Dismukes (Alsys [Telesoft]);
A. Evans (consultant); A. Gargaro (Computer Sciences Corp.);
M. Gerhardt (ESL); J. Goodenough (SEI); S. Heilbrunner
(University of Salzburg: Austria); P. Hilfinger
(UC/Berkeley); B. Kallberg (CelsiusTech: Sweden); M. Kamrad
II (Unisys); J. van Katwijk (Delft University of Technology:
The Netherlands); V. Kaufman (Russia); P. Kruchten
(Rational); R. Landwehr (CCI: Germany); C. Lester
(Portsmouth Polytechnic: UK); L. Mansson (TELIA Research:
Sweden); S. Michell (Multiprocessor Toolsmiths: Canada);
M. Mills (US Air Force); D. Pogge (US Navy); K. Power
(Boeing); O. Roubine (Verdix: France); A. Strohmeier (Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology: Switzerland); W. Taylor
(consultant: UK); J. Tokar (Tartan); E. Vasilescu (Grumman);
J. Vladik (Prospeks s.r.o.:  Czech Republic); S. Van Vlier-
berghe (OFFIS: Belgium).

<p>
   Early contributors on the Ada 9X Design Team were
C. Garrity, R. Hilliard, D. Rosenfeld, L. Shafer, W. White,
and M. Woodger.  Other valuable feedback influencing the
revision process was provided by the Ada 9X Language
Precision Team (Odyssey Research Associates), the Ada 9X
User/Implementer Teams (AETECH, Tartan, Alsys [Telesoft]),
the Ada 9X Implementation Analysis Team (New York
University), and the Volunteer Reviewers group under Art
Evans (consultant).
</p>
<p>
   The principal authors of this rationale document were
John Barnes and Ben Brosgol with valuable contributions from
Ken Dritz, Offer Pazy and Brian Wichmann.  Many thanks also
to  Bill Taylor for providing the material upon which Appendix
X is based, and to Tucker Taft and Robert Duff for their
comments and review.
</p>
<p>
   Very special thanks go to Virginia Castor, John Solomond
and Don Reifer from the Ada Joint Program Office for
supporting and sponsoring the Ada 9X Project since its
inception, and to Bob Mathis, Convenor of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22
Working Group 9, for shepherding the revision through the
standardization process.
</p>
<p>
   Last but not least, I want to extend my sincerest
appreciation to the Ada community at large who have
volunteered their time and energy on this project.  Without
your support we would not have been able to succeed.
</p>
<p>
   Ada 95 is here.  It is now up to the users, both those
who have appreciated the engineering benefits of Ada 83 and
others who may be frustrated with the hazards of their
current techniques, to move forward and reap the benefits of
this new language.
