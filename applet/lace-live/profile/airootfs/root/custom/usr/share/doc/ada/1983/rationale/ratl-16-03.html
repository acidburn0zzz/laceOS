<H2>CHAPTER 16: Input-Output</H2>

<H3><a name="16.3">16.3 Designation of Files</a></H3>

Input-output operations  effect data  exchanges between  a  processor,
running on  behalf of  the user  program, and  some peripheral device.
Traditionally,  the  notion  of  a  file,  seen  as  a  repository  of
information, is  often distinguished  from that  of a device. However,
the logical  behavior of  a program as a processor of information must
not depend  on the  source or destination of data, as long as the data
represents the  desired information.  For  example,  it  is  perfectly
reasonable to interface the same program with a disk file at one time,
and with a terminal at another time.
<p>
Consequently, the  conventions used  to designate  the  target  of  an
input-output operation should not necessarily distinguish between file
names, device  names, volume  names, and  so on.  In  addition,  these
conventions should  not conflict  with those  of any  operating system
under which the language is implemented. Thus we need to reconcile the
ability to  communicate with files in arbitrary operating systems with
the retention  of as  much portability as possible in the greater part
of the  program. This  is done  by distinguishing an external physical
file, whose  general properties  - in  particular the  lifetime -  are
quite outside  the realm of the Ada program, from an internal abstract
Ada object, upon which the program can operate with a well-defined set
of abstract operations.
<p>
The external  file is  conveniently  designated  by  a  string,  whose
interpretation is  completely implementation-dependent.  A  string  is
used for  this purpose  because of  its generality  and  accommodating
nature. This  string is  thus  a  parameter  (called  NAME)  of  those
procedures that  need to  identify an external file. There are in fact
two of  these: CREATE  which establishes a new external file, and OPEN
which refers  to an existing external file. In addition, it has proved
convenient to provide a second string parameter (called FORM), through
which arbitrary  auxiliary information  can be  supplied. The  default
value for  each of these parameters is the null string; in the case of
the name,  this is  conveniently taken  to indicate  a  temporary  and
anonymous file,  whereas in  the case  of the form it merely indicates
the absence of explicit auxiliary information.
<p>
Within the Ada program, the file is referred to via an Ada object of a
limited private  type. The  type is limited (rather than just private)
so that  the user  cannot make  arbitrary copies  of file objects, and
thereby prevent  the file  package from  having complete  control over
file access  and over the deallocation of internal buffer storage; for
a more extensive discussion of this technique see <a href="ratl-09-02.html#9.2.3">section 9.2.3</a>.
<p>
The connection  between the internal file object and the external file
is made  by passing  the object  as a  further parameter  to CREATE or
OPEN. All access to the external file is then made by referring to the
internal object.  This includes calls of CLOSE and DELETE, which sever
the connection  between the external file and the internal file object
and, in the case of DELETE, actually delete the external file itself.

<H3><BR><a name="16.3.1">16.3.1 Access Control</a></H3>

There is  a need  to provide  a degree  of access control, in order to
reduce the  risk of  inadvertently misusing  files. Typically,  a file
would have  a MODE,  which would allow read-only, write-only, or read-
and-write access. This could be done in a variety of ways, such as:
<ul>
<li>By providing  three quite  distinct file  types, such  as  IN_FILE,
   OUT_FILE and  INOUT_FILE, corresponding  to the access modes. (This
   was the approach taken in the <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Green</a> language.)
<p>
<li>By introducing an enumeration type FILE_MODE, with possible literal
   values IN_FILE,  OUT_FILE and  INOUT_FILE, and  then using a single
   file type with a discriminant thus:
<p>
     type FILE_TYPE(MODE :  FILE_MODE) is limited private;
<p>
<li>By having  a  single  file  type,  without  any  discriminant,  but
   associating each  file object  with a  dynamic property  that is  a
   value of  the enumeration  type FILE_MODE.  This  is  the  approach
   actually taken by Ada.
</ul>

At first sight, the first approach looks attractive. It means that the
correct use  of mode can be ensured at compilation time, with apparent
subsequent cost savings at run time. In practice, however, there are a
number of serious problems:
<ul>
<li>It is not possible to change the mode of a file without closing it,
   and then reopening it using a different file object; this makes the
   provision of  temporary files rather awkward. Of course, such files
   could be declared as INOUT, but this removes the security of access
   we were  looking for  in the  first place,  and is  counter to  the
   concept of sequential files.
<p>
<li>The individual  file types  make  it  impossible  to  write  single
   general procedures that apply to all files.
<p>
<li>The individual  types  cause  an  excessive  number  of  overloaded
   subprograms.
</ul>

Furthermore, the  apparent run-time  saving is usually illusory, since
the underlying  operating system inevitably carries out its own access
checks anyway.  (This would  not necessarily  apply in  the case  of a
system specifically written to support just Ada.)
<p>
We therefore  reject the first approach, and consider approaches using
a single  type. The  use of  a discriminant  to govern the access mode
appears neat;  it solves the problems of multiple types, and keeps the
access information  within the  type concept  but yet  visible to  the
user. However, since the type is limited, the user is unable to change
the discriminant anyway, and so this approach is unfruitful.
<p>
We thus  come to  the third  of  the  possibilities  outlined  at  the
beginning of this section. This offers a practical solution, which has
been adopted.
<p>
There is  a single type, FILE_TYPE, which applies to all files and, in
addition, a  quite separate  property of  each file, which governs its
access mode.  This property  is set  when a file is opened or created,
through a  parameter to  OPEN or  CREATE, and  can also  be changed by
calling the  procedure RESET.  The specifications  of these procedures
are thus
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure CREATE     (FILE  :  in out     FILE_TYPE;
                MODE :  in  FILE_MODE  :=  OUT_FILE;
                NAME :  in  STRING  :=  "";
                FORM :  in  STRING  :=  "");

procedure OPEN       (FILE  :  in out     FILE_TYPE;
               MODE  :  in  FILE_MODE;
               NAME  :  in  STRING;
               FORM  :  in  STRING  :=  "");

procedure RESET      (FILE  :  in out     FILE_TYPE;
               MODE  :  in  FILE_MODE);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  the MODE  has a  default value  of OUT_FILE  in the case of
CREATE. This  is sensible,  since it  is appropriate  that  the  first
action on  a newly  created file  is to  write to  it. (In the case of
direct files,  the default  is INOUT_FILE; this mode does not apply to
sequential and text files.)
<p>
The procedure  RESET repositions a file at the beginning, and can also
be used  to change the mode so that, having written a file, we can now
read it.  There is also a further overloading of RESET which omits the
second parameter  and just  repositions the  file without changing its
mode.
<p>
We conclude  this section  by observing that, although the system does
not give  the compilation  time security  that one  would have  liked,
nevertheless a  special secure  system of  the first category could be
built on  top of  the more  flexible current  one using derived types.
However, the  reverse is not possible, and so the present solution has
the  additional  merit  of  leaving  more  options  open  for  special
circumstances.

<H3><BR><a name="16.3.2">16.3.2 Default Files</a></H3>

It is  often the  case that  a number  of operations  are performed in
sequence on  the same  file. This  applies particularly in the case of
TEXT_IO, where a line of text typically comprises a mixture of numbers
and strings that are output by a series of different calls, such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
PUT(RESULTS,       "value   is    ");       PUT(RESULTS,    VALUE);
NEW_LINE(RESULTS);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
in which the repetition of the file name RESULTS is rather verbose.
<p>
In order  to overcome this, the various procedures have two overloaded
forms, one  with the  file parameter and one without - for example, in
the case of the type character:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure PUT(FILE    :  in FILE_TYPE;  ITEM :  in CHARACTER);
procedure PUT(ITEM    :  in CHARACTER);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If the  file parameter is omitted, an appropriate default file is used
- there  is one  for input and one for output. These default files are
initially set  to two  standard files, but can be changed by the user.
Thus we can more conveniently write
<p>
<PRE>    SET_OUTPUT(RESULTS);</PRE>
<p>
followed by
<p>
<PRE>    PUT("value is ");  PUT(VALUE);  NEW_LINE;</PRE>
<p>
The subprograms provided for the manipulation of the default files are
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure                 SET_OUTPUT(FILE :  in FILE_TYPE);
function                  STANDARD_OUTPUT return FILE_TYPE;
function                  CURRENT_OUTPUT  return FILE_TYPE;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
with corresponding  subprograms  for  input.  As  the  names  suggest,
SET_OUTPUT sets  the default  to the  specified file,  STANDARD_OUTPUT
returns the initial standard file, and CURRENT_OUTPUT returns the file
that is the present default file.
<p>
It is  thus possible to set the default file to that required locally,
and then to reset it to the standard, by:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SET_OUTPUT(local_file);
-- do the I/O
SET_OUTPUT(STANDARD_OUTPUT);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A more  general requirement  (in a  widely used  standard  subprogram,
perhaps) might  be to  surround the  local use  of a  default file  by
statements which  preserve and then restore the existing default file.
The function CURRENT_OUTPUT is provided so that this can be done.
