<H2>CHAPTER 13: Tasking</H2>

<H3><a name="13.3">13.3 Rationale for the Design of the Rendezvous Facilities</a></H3>

This section  starts by  briefly surveying  some of the more important
and  older  real-time  primitives  and  their  shortcomings.  It  then
considers the  concept of  rendezvous and  shows how  this concept has
influenced the design of the tasking facilities in Ada.

The understanding  of algorithmic  sequential processes  is based upon
that of  the evaluation  of arithmetic  and Boolean expressions, whose
axioms have  been well  understood for centuries. However, there is no
mathematical tradition  upon which  we can draw in order to help us to
understand the  behavior of  cooperating sequential  processes.  As  a
consequence  it   has  always  been  difficult  to  decide  whether  a
particular set  of real-time  primitives is good or not. Many sets can
be implemented in terms of each other but their relative primitiveness
is often hard to perceive.
<p>
Broadly speaking  the primitives  (or perhaps the applications) can be
divided into  two categories.  The first enables common data or common
code to  be protected from multiple usage. The second enables one task
to send  a message  to another; this includes the degenerate case of a
signal, which can be thought of as a message with no content.
<p>
One of  the oldest  and  best  known  primitive  sets  is  the  binary
semaphore described  by Dijkstra  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Di 68]</a>.  This consists  of the  two
operators P  and V,  acting on  a semaphore  S which takes two values,
busy and  free (or  equivalently true  and false). The behavior of the
operations is:

<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=6><tr><th>
P(S)
</th><td>
If S  is busy  the task  is suspended until S becomes
free. If S is free then it is set busy and the task proceeds.
</td></tr><tr><th>
V(S)
</th><td>
S is  set free.  If there are tasks held up on a P(S)
operation then one of them is allowed to proceed.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>

Semaphores can  be used  to protect  data by  embedding the  code that
accesses the data between matched calls thus:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
P(S)
  -- access data      
V(S)

task A
</pre></td><td><pre>
P(S)
  -- access data      
V(S)

task B
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Semaphores can  also be  used to  signal happenings. One task waits by
calling P, the other signals by calling V.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
P(S) -- wait for B    

task A            
</pre></td><td><pre>
V(S) -- signal to A    

task B
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Semaphores  can   therefore  be  used  both  for  protection  and  for
signalling. They also have the merit of being primitives that are both
simple to  describe and  easy  to  understand.  What  then  are  their
disadvantages? Briefly  the problem  is that  for all but the simplest
applications, the  programming of  semaphores is  difficult.  Programs
using semaphores  exhibit similar  symptoms to  unstructured  programs
using gotos.  They are hard to write, understand, prove, and maintain.
More specifically, typical problems are:
<ul>
<li>One can  jump around  a call of P and therefore accidentally access
   unprotected data.
<p>
<li>One can  jump around  a  call  of  V  and  accidentally  leave  the
   semaphore busy so that the system deadlocks.
<p>
<li>One can forget to use them.
<p>
<li>It is  not possible to program an alternative action if a semaphore
   is found to be busy when attempting P.
<p>
<li>It is  not possible  to wait  for one  of several  semaphores to be
   free.
<p>
<li>Semaphores are often visible to tasks that need not access them.
</ul>

An extended  form of  semaphore is the integer semaphore. In this case
the value  is an  integer rather  than a  boolean. It  is particularly
useful for  allowing a  limited number  of tasks  to have  access to a
resource. Nevertheless  it has  been shown  that the integer semaphore
can be programmed in terms of binary semaphores, and so in practice it
is only marginally more useful.
<p>
Closely related  to the  semaphore is  the signal  or event. There are
variations, but  a typical definition would be that an event E has two
states, set and unset, and the following operations upon it:
<p>
<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=6><tr><th>
WAIT(E)
</th><td>
If E  has not  been set  then the task is suspended until the
event is set. If E has been set then it is unset and the task
is allowed to proceed.
</td></tr><tr><th>
SEND(E)
</th><td>
E is  set. If  there are tasks waiting for E then one of them
is allowed to proceed.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Clearly such  an event  is isomorphic  to the  binary  semaphore.  The
difference lies perhaps in the intended use. Semaphores are associated
with data  protection, and  events with  indicating that something has
happened. There are variations in which several events are remembered.
But in  all forms, events suffer from the same structuring problems as
semaphores.
<p>
Various other  primitives have  been proposed in order to overcome the
structuring difficulties  of  semaphores  and  events.  However,  they
usually tackle  only one  of the application areas distinguished above
(data protection  and signalling).  In this  respect they are somewhat
unbalanced.
<p>
The critical  section has been proposed as a syntactic form equivalent
to a  bracketed pair  of  P  and  V  operations.  This  prevents  goto
statements from  bypassing one  of the  operations and hence overcomes
some  of   the  difficulties   of  semaphores.  A  further  form,  the
conditional critical  section, allows  an  alternative  action  to  be
performed if the resource represented is busy.
<p>
Critical sections do not seem to have been successful. They solve only
the exclusion  problem and  need to  be complemented with a signalling
mechanism; this  does not  lead to  the unification sought by language
designers.
<p>
Many forms  of message switching system have been implemented in order
to give  improved solutions  to the  signalling problem  (see <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BH  70,
73]</a>). Typically  they enable  messages to  be sent  between tasks, and
allow the  source or  destination of  the  message  to  be  optionally
specified.  They   therefore  give   added  protection  by  preventing
unauthorized access to messages.
<p>
Perhaps the  biggest disadvantage of message systems is the need for a
sizeable message controller. Message systems also seem to be of an ad-
hoc nature  with an  apparently arbitrary  set of parameters. Moreover
they do  not easily  solve exclusion  problems  because  of  the  high
overhead involved.
<p>
A significant  step forward was the monitor, first described by Brinch
Hansen <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BH  73,75]</a> and  by Hoare <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Ho 74]</a>. This includes the facilities
of the critical section, and when combined with events (as in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula</a>),
gives a  reasonable solution  to problems  such as the bounded buffer.
The monitor  solves the exclusion problem but not the message problem.
Indeed the  signals  in  Modula  still  suffer  from  the  structuring
problems of semaphores.

<H3><BR><a name="13.3.2">13.3.2 The Rendezvous Concept</a></H3>

Another line  of approach  to mutual exclusion and synchronization was
introduced in early computer science by Conway <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Co 63]</a> with the notion
of coroutine,  the first  definition of  a high-level  synchronization
mechanism. One  of the  important concepts  introduced by  Conway (and
maybe forgotten  later) is  that synchronization and data transmission
are  two  inseparable  activities.  Two  parallel  tasks  need  to  be
synchronized to  exchange information  - thereafter  they resume their
respective activities;  this synchronization is known as a rendezvous.
Two papers  by Hoare  <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Ho 78]</a>  and Brinch  Hansen <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[BH  78]</a> proposed  a
rethink of  parallel processing in terms of this concept of rendezvous
and strongly influenced the design of Ada.
<p>
The difficult problem that arises here is one of making tasks known to
each other.  Tasks have names that identify them unambiguously. Should
these names be used by tasks to synchronize with each other, or should
there  exist   a  further   entity  that  makes  both  candidates  for
synchronization known  to each  other  by  reference  to  some  common
channel?  These   two  solutions   are  extreme   forms  of  symmetric
communication; either  each communicating  task has  full knowledge of
its colleague,  or it has no information at all. Both solutions appear
in the literature: <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Ho 78]</a> and <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Ka 74]</a>.
<p>
We rejected  the channel  solution in this design in order to avoid an
additional language  concept and the dual connection mechanism that it
requires. The  solution adopted  in Ada,  although closer  to the  one
proposed by  Hoare, is  asymmetric: one of the two communicating tasks
knows the  name of  the other and names it explicitly; the second task
knows only that it expects some external interaction.
<p>
In order  to  justify  the  asymmetry,  let  us  first  summarize  the
symmetric proposal developed by Hoare and embedded in a language which
has become  known as CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes). In CSP,
communication between  tasks is seen as synchronized input-output: one
task outputs  data which  the other  inputs, and both tasks rendezvous
during the  transfer -  that is,  the first  to arrive at its input or
output statement  waits for  the other  and they both then execute the
I/O statements  together (or  apparently together)  before  proceeding
independently. Each task names the other in the transfer. The transfer
can be  thought of as an assignment split into two parts with the left
side in one task and the right side in the other.
<p>
As an example we shall consider a task BUFFER, to smooth variations in
the speed  of output  of items  by a  producer task  and  input  by  a
consumer task (given in <a href="ratl-13-02.html#13.2.5">section 13.2.5</a>). The program is as follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
BUFFER ::
  pool :  (1 .. 10) item;
  inindex, outindex, count :  integer;
  inindex :=  1;  outindex :=  1;  count :=  0;
    &#42; [count &lt; 10;  producer?pool(inindex) -&gt;
      inindex :=  inindex mod 10 + 1;  count :=  count + 1
    [] count &gt; 0;  consumer?more() -&gt;
       consumer!pool(outindex);
       outindex :=  outindex mod 10 + 1;  count :=  count - 1
    ]
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The key language statements in this example are:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
X  ?   Y     Input Y from task X
X  !   Y     Output Y to task X
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On each  iteration the  guards "count  &lt;  10"  and  "count  &gt;  0"  are
evaluated. If both guards are true then calls from either the consumer
or producer are acceptable and the first such call will be waited for;
if both  have already  made such  a call  and are therefore themselves
waiting then  a nondeterministic  choice will be made; if only one has
made a  call then  obviously that call is taken. If, however, only one
guard is  true then  only the  corresponding call can be accepted, and
the other  task will  wait until  the buffer  is partially  filled  or
emptied as  the case  may be.  In this  example both  guards cannot be
false and so the iterative process continues indefinitely.
<p>
In the producer case the statement
<p>
<PRE>    producer  ?  pool(inindex)</PRE>
<p>
moves the  item into  the buffer  directly. In  the consumer  case the
statement
<p>
<PRE>    consumer  ?  more()</PRE>
<p>
indicates that the consumer is ready and a subsequent
<p>
<PRE>    consumer  !  pool(outindex)</PRE>
<p>
actually does  the transfer.  The  producer  task  therefore  contains
statements such as
<p>
<PRE>    BUFFER  !  X</PRE>
<p>
whereas the consumer task has pairs such as
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
BUFFER  !  more();
BUFFER  ?  X
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Note that  more() denotes a structured value with no components and is
used here as a signal.
<p>
As can  be seen the program is readable, although perhaps presented in
a terse  style by  traditional high-level language standards. However,
there are  two problems  with CSP.  One is  that a  (one-to-one) named
correspondence is  required; because  of  this  symmetry,  it  is  not
possible  to  program  a  library  routine  to  provide  resources  to
arbitrary users.  The other  problem is  that a  double interaction is
required for  the consumer;  this means that the two calls really need
to be  encapsulated by  a single  procedure in  order to  give a clean
interface.
<p>
In  Ada,   as  we  have  seen,  naming  is  one-sided.  Tasks  can  be
characterized as  services or as users. A user certainly needs to know
the name  of the service it is requesting. On the other hand, a server
need not  know the  names of  its users.  Because of this asymmetry it
possible to  program the above library routine. As a consequence there
can be  queues of  waiting tasks associated with each request. On each
successful rendezvous just one waiting task is served.
<p>
The other  important concept  introduced in  Ada is  the notion of the
extended rendezvous.  This notion  is a major breakthrough to a higher
level of  abstraction. In  the case  of the task BUFFER this overcomes
the need  for the double rendezvous with the consumer. This is seen by
comparing the  example in  <a href="ratl-13-02.html#13.2.5">section 13.2.5</a> with that above. Thus we now
have
<p>
<PRE>    BUFFER.READ(X);</PRE>
<p>
rather than  the two  statements of  CSP. This  also  illustrates  the
procedural  form   of  entry  call  as  opposed  to  some  specialized
statements. As we have seen, this enables a similar external interface
to be presented, even if a change of solution demands that a procedure
be replaced by an entry or vice versa.
<p>
The extended  rendezvous is more disciplined since it ensures that the
same task  performs the interaction throughout. It is also instructive
to consider  the same  example written  in <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Modula</a>  using  monitors  as
follows:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
interface module buffer;
  define put, get;
  const poolsize = 10;
  var pool :  array [1 .. poolsize] of item;
  inindex, outindex, count :  integer;
  nonfull, nonempty :  signal;

  procedure put (x :  item);
  begin
    if count = poolsize then wait(nonfull) end;
    pool [inindex] :=  x;
    inindex :=  inindex mod poolsize + 1;  count :=  count + 1;
    send(nonempty)
  end put;

  procedure get (var x :  item);
  begin
    if count = 0 then wait(nonempty) end;
    x :=  pool [outindex];
    outindex :=  outindex mod poolsize + 1;  count :=  count - 1;
    send(nonfull)
  end get;
begin
  inindex :=  1;  outindex :=  1;  count :=  0
end buffer;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The producer and consumer processes move the items by calls such as
<p>
<PRE>    put(x)      and      get(x)</PRE>
<p>
respectively. This  is satisfactory,  but the internal behavior of the
monitor is  not nearly  as clear  as in  CSP and  Ada. The  rendezvous
mechanism is  more  disciplined  than  a  monitor,  since  the  accept
statements appear  inside a  context (for  example following  a guard)
from which  information can  be  deduced,  thereby  facilitating  both
understanding and proof.
<p>
Perhaps the  most important  point about both CSP and Ada is that they
offer mechanisms  that are  applicable to  both  data  protection  and
signalling. Earlier  attempts to  develop features  at a  higher level
than semaphores  or events  (such as  message  systems  and  monitors)
seemed to  solve only  one problem,  and  by  offering  an  unbalanced
solution were not clearly better than the original simple primitives.
<p>
The rationale  behind the accept statement and entry call is simply to
provide a  rendezvous. In  some applications  it is  necessary that  a
rendezvous be  achieved, whereas  in others  it is  important for  the
caller not  to be  held up.  It is  much more  difficult to  program a
rendezvous in  terms of  non-rendezvous primitives  than  vice  versa.
Hence the rendezvous has been chosen as the natural primitive.
<p>
It is  noted that  calls are  accepted in simple order of arrival. The
alternative of  making the  order depend on some parameter of the call
was  considered   and  rejected   because   of   the   difficulty   of
implementation, which  could severely penalize the simple user. As has
been demonstrated in the examples, it is possible to program different
strategies when necessary.
<p>
The introduction  of entries  leads naturally  to the  unification  of
tasks and  packages. A  task encapsulates entries in the same way as a
package encapsulates  procedures. Moreover  there is  a strong analogy
between on  the one  hand the  specification, in which the entries are
specified, and  the body,  containing the  sequence that  controls the
critical actions, and on the other hand the corresponding subdivisions
of  a  package  with  respect  to  the  specification  and  bodies  of
procedures.
<p>
However, this  unification has  its limits.  It  proved  necessary  to
disallow  entities   other  than  entries  in  the  specification.  As
mentioned earlier,  this was  partly for  methodological  reasons  and
partly because  of the  cost of  preventing access  to variables of an
inactive task and of implementing access on a distributed system.
<p>
The general applicability of the rendezvous concept has been confirmed
by its  use in  other  examples.  This  concept  is  well  adapted  to
distributed systems  -  communication  is  achieved  by  entry  calls,
exchanged data  is passed  via parameters.  From  a  more  theoretical
viewpoint, it is interesting to note that path expressions <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[CH 74]</a> can
be shown to be easily expressible in terms of rendezvous primitives.
