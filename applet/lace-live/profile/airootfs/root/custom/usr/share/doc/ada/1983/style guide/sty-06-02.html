The need for tasks to communicate gives rise to most of the problems that make 
concurrent programming so difficult. Used properly, Ada's intertask 
communication features can improve the reliability of concurrent programs; 
used thoughtlessly, they can introduce subtle errors that can be difficult to 
detect and correct.<P>

<li>Minimize the work performed in the selective wait loop of a task. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
In the following example, the statements in the accept body are performed as  
part of the execution of both the caller task and the task <CODE>Server</CODE> which  
contains <CODE>Operation</CODE> and <CODE>Operation2</CODE>. The statements after the accept body are  
executed before Server can accept additional calls to <CODE>Operation</CODE> or <CODE>Operation2</CODE>.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   ... 
   loop 
      select 
         accept Operation do
         
            -- These statements are executed during rendezvous. 
            -- Both caller and server are blocked during this time. 
            ... 
         end Operation;
         
         ... 
         -- These statements are not executed during rendezvous. 
         -- Their execution delays getting back to the accept and 
         --   may be a candidate for another task.
         
      or 
         accept Operation_2 do
         
            -- These statements are executed during rendezvous. 
            -- Both caller and server are blocked during this time. 
            ... 
         end Operation_2;
         
      end select; 
      -- These statements are also not executed during rendezvous, 
      -- Their execution delays getting back to the accept and may 
      --   be a candidate for another task.
      
   end loop;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Only work that needs to be performed during a rendezvous, such as saving or  
generating parameters, should be allowed in the accept bodies to minimize the  
time required to rendezvous.<P>
When work is removed from the accept body and placed later in the selective 
wait loop, the additional work may still suspend the caller task. If the 
caller task calls entry <CODE>Operation</CODE> again before the server task completes its 
additional work, the caller is delayed until the server completes the 
additional work. If the potential delay is unacceptable and the additional 
work does not need to be completed before the next service of the caller task, 
the additional work may form the basis of a new task that will not block the 
caller task.

<H4>note</H4>
In some cases, additional functions may be added to a task. For example, a 
task controlling a communication device may be responsible for a periodic 
function to ensure that the device is operating correctly. This type of 
addition should be done with care realizing that the response time of the task 
is impacted (see rationale).

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Task communication overhead must be balanced with the associated blocking. 
Each time a new task is introduced, there is a timing impact caused by 
scheduling and synchronization with the new task. Be careful when introducing 
tasks to reduce blocking. The reduction in blocking time will cause increased 
task scheduling and synchronization overhead and software architecture 
complexity.<P>

In this select statement, if all the guards happen to be closed, exception

<H4>rationale</H4>
The exception <CODE>Program_Error</CODE> is raised if a selective wait statement (select  
statement containing accepts) is reached, all of whose alternatives are closed  
(i.e., the guards evaluate to <CODE>False</CODE> and there are no alternatives without  
guards), unless there is an else part. When all alternatives are closed, the  
task can never again progress, so there is by definition an error in its  
programming. You must be prepared to handle this error should it occur.<P>
Since an else part cannot have a guard, it can never be closed off as an  
alternative action, thus its presence prevents <CODE>Program_Error</CODE>. However, an else  
part, a delay alternative, and a terminate alternative are all mutually  
exclusive, so you will not always be able to provide an else part. In these  
cases, you must be prepared to handle <CODE>Program_Error</CODE>.<P>
The exception <CODE>Tasking_Error</CODE> can be raised in the calling task whenever it 
attempts to communicate. There are many situations permitting this. Few of 
them are preventable by the calling task.<P>
If an exception is raised during a rendezvous and not handled in the accept  
statement, it is propagated to both tasks and must be handled in two places.  
See <a href="sty-05-08.html#5.8">Guideline 5.8</a>.

<H4>note</H4>
There are other ways to prevent <CODE>Program_Error</CODE> at a selective wait. These 
involve leaving at least one alternative unguarded, or proving that at least 
one guard will evaluate <CODE>True</CODE> under all circumstances. The point here is that 
you, or your successors, will make mistakes in trying to do this, so you 
should prepare to handle the inevitable exception.<P>

Attributes <CODE>'Callable</CODE>, <CODE>'Terminated</CODE>, and <CODE>'Count</CODE> are all subject to race  
conditions. Between the time you reference an attribute and the time you take  
action the value of the attribute may change. Attributes <CODE>'Callable</CODE> and  
<CODE>'Terminated</CODE> convey reliable information once they become <CODE>False</CODE> and <CODE>True</CODE>,  
respectively. If <CODE>'Callable</CODE> is <CODE>False</CODE>, you can expect the callable state to  
remain constant. If <CODE>'Terminated</CODE> is <CODE>True</CODE>, you can expect the task to remain  
terminated. Otherwise, <CODE>'Terminated</CODE> and <CODE>'Callable</CODE> can change between the time  
your code tests them and the time it responds to the result. <P>
The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual (Department of Defense 1983)</a> itself warns 
about the asynchronous increase and decrease of the value of <CODE>'Count</CODE>. A task 
can be removed from an entry queue due to execution of an abort statement as 
well as expiration of a timed entry call. The use of this attribute in guards 
of a selective wait statement may result in the opening of alternatives which 
should not be opened under a changed value of <CODE>'Count</CODE>.<P>

There are many techniques for protecting and synchronizing data access. You  
must program most of them yourself to use them. It is difficult to write a  
program that shares data correctly. If it is not done correctly, the  
reliability of the program suffers. Ada provides the rendezvous to support  
synchronization and communication of information between tasks. Data that you  
might be tempted to share can be put into a task body with read and write  
entries to access it.<P>
The first example above has a race condition requiring perfect interleaving of 
execution. This code can be made more reliable by introducing a flag that is 
set by <CODE>Spool_Server</CODE> and reset by <CODE>Line_Printer_Driver</CODE>. An <CODE>if (condition flag) 
then delay ... else</CODE> would be added to each task loop in order to ensure that 
the interleaving is satisfied. However, notice that this approach requires a 
delay and the associated rescheduling. Presumably this rescheduling overhead 
is what is being avoided by not using the rendezvous.<P>
A guard is a conditional select alternative starting with a when (see <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-09-07.html#9.7.1">9.7.1 in 
Department of Defense 1983</a>). The second example above also has a race 
condition requiring two different things. First, the task that opens the doors 
must open the doors and update <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE> before allowing the intercept task 
to continue execution. Second, the run time system evaluation of the guard in 
the select statement cannot occur until the <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE> matches the next 
anticipated entry call. If the next call will be to <CODE>ARM</CODE>, then you must make 
sure that <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE> changes to <CODE>False</CODE> before the Intercept task reevaluates 
the select statement. If the select statement is evaluated while <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE> is 
<CODE>True</CODE> and <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE> is subsequently set to <CODE>False</CODE>, the select will continue to 
wait on the <CODE>Launch</CODE> until a <CODE>Launch</CODE> is received. An alternate approach is to use 
<CODE>Local_Doors_Open</CODE> in the example. This guarantees that the guards will be 
reevaluated upon a change in the value of <CODE>Doors_Open</CODE>.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
For some required synchronizations the rendezvous may not meet time 
constraints. Each case should be analyzed in detail to justify the use of 
pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE>, which presumably has less overhead than the rendezvous. Be 
careful to correctly implement a data access synchronization technique. 
Without great effort you might get it wrong. Pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE> can serve as an 
expedient against poor run time support systems. Do not always use this as an 
excuse to avoid the rendezvous because implementations are allowed to ignore 
pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE> (Nissen and Wallis 1984). When pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE> is implemented by 
compilers, the implementation is not always uniform and can still lead to 
nonportable code. Pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE> affects only those objects whose storage and 
retrieval are implemented as indivisible operations. Also, pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE>
can only be used for variables of scalar or access type.

<H4>note</H4>
As pointed out above, a guarantee of noninterference may be difficult with  
implementations that ignore pragma <CODE>Shared</CODE>. If you must share data, share the  
absolute minimum amount necessary, and be especially careful. As always,  
encapsulate the synchronization portions of code.<P>
The problem is with variables. Constants, such as tables fixed at compile 
time, may be safely shared between tasks.<P>

Use of these constructs always poses a risk of race conditions. Using them in  
loops, particularly with poorly chosen task priorities, can have the effect of  
busy waiting.<P>
These constructs are very much implementation dependent. For conditional entry 
calls and selective waits with else parts, the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual</a> 
(Department of Defense 1983) does not define &quot;immediately.&quot; For timed entry 
calls and selective waits with delay alternatives, implementors may have ideas 
of time that differ from each other and from your own. Like the delay 
statement, the delay alternative on the select construct might wait longer 
than the time required (see <a href="sty-06-01.html#6.1.5">Guideline 6.1.5</a>).<P>

<li>Minimize the number of accept and select statements per task.

<H4>example</H4>
Use
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>accept A; 
if Mode_1 then 
   -- do one thing 
else  -- Mode_2 
   -- do something different 
end if;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
rather than
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if Mode_1 then 
   accept A; 
   -- do one thing
   
else  -- Mode_2 
   accept A; 
   -- do something different 
end if;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
This guideline reduces conceptual complexity. Only entries necessary to  
understand externally observable task behavior should be introduced. If there  
are several different accept and select statements that do not modify task  
behavior in a way important to the user of the task, there is unnecessary  
complexity introduced by the proliferation of select/accept statements.  
Externally observable behavior important to the task user includes task timing  
behavior, task rendezvous initiated by the entry calls, prioritization of  
entries, or data updates (where data is shared between tasks).<P>
