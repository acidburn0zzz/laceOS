Careless or convoluted use of statements can make a program hard to read and 
maintain even if its global structure is well organized. You should strive for 
simple and consistent use of statements to achieve clarity of local program 
structure. Some of the guidelines in this section counsel use or avoidance of 
particular statements. As pointed out in the individual guidelines, rigid 
adherence to those guidelines would be excessive, but experience has shown 
that they generally lead to code with improved reliability and 
maintainability.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Deeply nested structures are confusing, difficult to understand, and difficult 
to maintain. The problem lies in the difficulty of determining what part of a 
program is contained at any given level. For expressions, this is important in 
achieving the correct placement of balanced grouping symbols and in achieving 
the desired operator precedence. For control structures, the question involves 
what part is controlled. Specifically, is a given statement at the proper 
level of nesting, i.e., is it too deeply or too shallowly nested, or is the 
given statement associated with the proper choice, e.g., for if or case 
statements?  Indentation helps, but it is not a panacea. Visually inspecting 
alignment of indented code (mainly intermediate levels) is an uncertain job at 
best. To minimize the complexity of the code, keep the maximum number of 
nesting levels between three and five.

<H4><a name="5.6.1_note">note</a></H4>
Ask yourself the following questions to help you simplify the code:
<UL TYPE=square>
<li>Can some part of the expression be put into a constant or variable?  
<li>Does some part of the lower nested control structures represent a  
significant, and perhaps reusable computation that I can factor into a  
subprogram?  
<li>Can I convert these nested if statements into a case statement?  
<li>Am I using <CODE>else if</CODE> where I could be using <CODE>elsif</CODE>?  
<li>Can I reorder the conditional expressions controlling this nested  
structure?  
<li>Is there a different design that would be simpler? 
</UL>

<H4>exceptions</H4>
If deep nesting is required frequently, there may be overall design decisions  
for the code that should be changed. Some algorithms require deeply nested  
loops and segments controlled by conditional branches. Their continued use can  
be ascribed to their efficiency, familiarity, and time proven utility. When  
nesting is required, proceed cautiously and take special care with the choice  
of identifiers and loop and block names. <P>

An assignment statement with slices is simpler and clearer than a loop, and 
helps the reader see the intended action. Slice assignment can be faster than 
a loop if a block move instruction is available.<P>

<UL>
<li>Never use an others choice in a case statement. 
<li>Do not use ranges of enumeration literals in case statements.

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Color is (Red, Green, Blue, Purple); 
Car_Color : Color := Red;

<P>
Now consider a change in the type:<P>
<IMG SRC="indent.gif"><CODE>type Color is (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple);</CODE><P>
This change may have an unnoticed and undesired effect in the case statement.  
If the choices had been enumerated explicitly, as <CODE>when Red | Green | Blue =&gt;</CODE>  
instead of <CODE>when Red .. Blue =&gt;</CODE>, then the case statement would have not have  
compiled. This would have forced the maintainer to make a conscious decision  
about what to do in the case of <CODE>Yellow</CODE>.

<H4>rationale</H4>
All possible values for an object should be known and should be assigned  
specific actions. Use of an others clause may prevent the developer from  
carefully considering the actions for each value. A compiler warns the user  
about omitted values, if an others clause is not used.  <P>
Each possible value should be explicitly enumerated. Ranges can be dangerous  
because of the possibility that the range could change and the case statement  
may not be reexamined.

<H4>exception</H4>
It is acceptable to use ranges for possible values only when the user is  
certain that new values will never be inserted among the old ones, as for  
example, in the range of ASCII characters: <CODE>'a' .. 'z'.</CODE>

<H4>note</H4>
Ranges that are needed in case statements can use constrained subtypes to  
enhance maintainability.  It is easier to maintain because the declaration of  
the range can be placed where it is logically part of the abstraction, not  
buried in a case statement in the executable code.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>subtype Lower_Case is Character range       'a' ..      'z'; 
subtype Upper_Case is Character range       'A' ..      'Z'; 
subtype Control    is Character range ASCII.Nul .. ASCII.Us; 
subtype Numbers    is Character range       '0' ..      '9';

... 
case Input_Char is 
   when Lower_Case =&gt;         Capitalize(Input_Char); 
   when Upper_Case =&gt;         null; 
   when Control    =&gt;         raise Invalid_Input;

while not Condition_Dependent_On_P loop 
   Q; 
   P; 
end loop;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
A for loop is bounded, so it cannot be an &quot;infinite loop.&quot; This is enforced by 
the Ada language which requires a finite range in the loop specification and 
which does not allow the loop counter of a for loop to be modified by a 
statement executed within the loop. This yields a certainty of understanding 
for the reader and the writer not associated with other forms of loops. A for 
loop is also easier to maintain because the iteration range can be expressed 
using attributes of the data structures upon which the loop operates, as shown 
in the example above where the range changes automatically whenever the 
declaration of the array is modified. For these reasons, it is best to use the 
for loop whenever possible; that is, whenever simple expressions can be used 
to describe the first and last values of the loop counter.<P>
The while loop has become a very familiar construct to most programmers. At a 
glance it indicates the condition under which the loop continues. Use the 
while loop whenever it is not possible to use the for loop, but there is a 
simple boolean expression describing the conditions under which the loop 
should continue, as shown in the example above.<P>
The plain loop statement should be used in more complex situations, even if it  
is possible to contrive a solution using a for or while loop in conjunction  
with extra flag variables or exit statements. The criteria in selecting a loop  
construct is to be as clear and maintainable as possible. It is a bad idea to  
use an exit statement from within a for or while loop because it is misleading  
to the reader after having apparently described the complete set of loop  
conditions at the top of the loop. A reader who encounters a plain loop  
statement expects to see exit statements.<P>
There are some familiar looping situations which are best achieved with the 
plain loop statement. For example, the semantics of the Pascal repeat until 
loop, where the loop is always executed at least once before the termination 
test occurs, are best achieved by a plain loop with a single exit at the end 
of the loop. Another common situation is the &quot;loop and a half&quot; construct, 
shown in the example above, where a loop must terminate somewhere within the 
sequence of statements of the body. Complicated &quot;loop and a half&quot; constructs 
simulated with while loops often require the introduction of flag variables, 
or duplication of code before and during the loop, as shown in the example. 
Such contortions make the code more complex and less reliable.<P>
Minimize the number of ways to exit a loop in order to make the loop more  
understandable to the reader. It should be rare that you need more than two  
exit paths from a loop. When you do, be sure to use exit statements for all of  
them, rather than adding an exit statement to a for or while loop.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
It is more readable to use exit statements than to try to add boolean flags to 
a while loop condition to simulate exits from the middle of a loop. Even if 
all exit statements would be clustered at the top of the loop body, the 
separation of a complex condition into multiple exit statements can simplify 
and make it more readable and clear. The sequential execution of two exit 
statements is often more clear than the short-circuit control forms.<P>
The <CODE>exit when</CODE> form is preferable to the <CODE>if ... then, exit</CODE> form because it 
makes the word <CODE>exit</CODE> more visible by not nesting it inside of any control 
construct.  The <CODE>if ... then exit</CODE> form is needed only in the case where other 
statements, in addition to the exit statement, must be executed conditionally. 
For example:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if Status = Done then

   Shut_Down; 
   return;
   
end if;</pre></td></tr></table>

Loops with many scattered exit statements can indicate fuzzy thinking as  
regards the loop's purpose in the algorithm. Such an algorithm might be coded  
better some other way, e.g., with a series of loops. Some rework can often  
reduce the number of exit statements and make the code clearer.<P>

Establishing an iteration bound:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Safety_Counter := 0;

Process_List: 
   loop 
      exit when Current_Item = null;

         raise Safety_Error;

Establishing a recursion bound:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>procedure Depth_First (Root           : in     Tree; 
                       Safety_Counter : in     Recursion_Bound 
                                      := Recursion_Bound'Last) is 
begin 
   if Root /= null then
   
      if Safety_Counter = 0 then 
         raise Recursion_Error; 
      end if;
      
      Depth_First

      ... -- normal subprogram body 
   end if;
   
end Depth_First;</pre></td></tr></table>

Following are examples of this subprogram's usage. One call specifies a 
maximum recursion depth of 50. The second takes the default (one thousand). 
The third uses a computed bound:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Depth_First(Root, 50); 
Depth_First(Root); 
Depth_First(Root, Current_Tree_Height);</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Recursion, and iteration using structures other than <CODE>for</CODE> statements, can be 
infinite because the expected terminating condition does not arise. Such 
faults are sometimes quite subtle, may occur rarely, and may be difficult to 
detect because an external manifestation might be absent or substantially 
delayed.<P>
By including counters and checks on the counter values, in addition to the 
loops themselves, you can prevent many forms of infinite loops. The inclusion 
of such checks is one aspect of the technique called Safe Programming 
(Anderson and Witty 1978).<P>
The bounds of these checks do not have to be exact, just realistic. Such 
counters and checks are not part of the primary control structure of the 
program but a benign addition functioning as an execution-time &quot;safety net&quot; 
allowing error detection and possibly recovery from potential infinite loops 
or infinite recursion.

<H4>note</H4>
If a loop uses the <CODE>for</CODE> iteration scheme (<a href="#5.6.4">Guideline 5.6.4</a>), it follows this  guideline.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
Embedded control applications have loops that are intended to be infinite. 
Only a few loops within such applications should qualify as exceptions to this 
guideline. The exceptions should be deliberate (and documented) policy 
decisions.<P>
This guideline is most important to safety critical systems. For other 
systems, it may be overkill.<P>

A goto statement is an unstructured change in the control flow. Worse, the

Other languages use goto statements to implement loop exits and exception

extremely rare.

Excessive use of returns can make code confusing and unreadable. Only use 
return statements where warranted. Too many returns from a subprogram may be 
an indicator of cluttered logic. If the application requires multiple returns, 
use them at the same level (i.e., as in different branches of a case 
statement), rather than scattered throughout the subprogram code. Some rework 
can often reduce the number of return statements to one and make the code more

Blocks break up large segments of code and isolate details relevant to each  
subsection of code.  Variables that are only used in a particular section of  
code are clearly visible when a declarative block delineates that code.<P>
Renaming may simplify the expression of algorithms and enhance readability for 
a given section of code.  But it is confusing when a <CODE>rename</CODE> clause is visually 
separated from the code to which it applies.  The declarative region allows 
the renames to be immediately visible when the reader is examining code which 
uses that abbreviation.  <a href="sty-05-07.html#5.7.1">Guideline 5.7.1</a> discusses a similar guideline 
concerning the `use' clause.<P>
Local exception handlers can catch exceptions close to the point of origin and  
allow them to either be handled, propagated, or converted.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="5.6.10">5.6.10  Aggregates</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Use an aggregate instead of a sequence of assignments to assign values  
to all components of a record. 
<li> Use an aggregate instead of a temporary variable when building a 
record to pass as an actual parameter. 
<li>Use positional association only when there is a conventional ordering  
of the arguments. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
It is better to use aggregates:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Set_Position((X, Y));

Employee_Record :=  (Number     =&gt; 42, 
                     Age        =&gt; 51, 
                     Department =&gt; Software_Engineering);</pre></td></tr></table>

than to use consecutive assignments or temporary variables:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>Temporary_Position.X := 100; 
Temporary_Position.Y := 200; 
Set_Position(Temporary_Position);

Employee_Record.Number     := 42; 
Employee_Record.Age        := 51; 
Employee_Record.Department := Software_Engineering;</pre></td></tr></table>

Using aggregates during maintenance is beneficial. If a record structure is 
altered, but the corresponding aggregate is not, the compiler flags the 
missing field in the aggregate assignment. It would not be able to detect the 
fact that a new assignment statement should have been added to a list of 
assignment statements.<P>
Aggregates can also be a real convenience in combining data items into a 
record or array structure required for passing the information as a parameter. 
Named component association makes aggregates more readable.<P>
