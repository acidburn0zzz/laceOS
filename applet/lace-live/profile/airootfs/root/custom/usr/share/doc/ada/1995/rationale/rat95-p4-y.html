<h1>
Appendix Y   Revisions To Drafts
</h1>

<p>
The final International Standard for Ada 95 incorporates a number of
changes to the Committee Draft [CD 93] of September 1993 (version 4.0 of
RM9X) and the Draft International Standard [DIS 94] of June 1994 (version
5.0).  These were made in response to formal comments made by the ISO
members as part of the ballots on these drafts and to informal comments
made by individual reviewers.
</p>
<p>
   Although many of the changes are of an editorial nature several are of
significance to the normal user.  The more important changes are outlined
in this appendix for the convenience of readers familiar with the drafts.
Unless otherwise mentioned changes are with respect to the CD; if a
change has occurred since the DIS then this is explicitly mentioned.  A
reference to that section of the rationale containing further discussion
of the topic is given where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
   The organization of the standard has been rearranged into a more
logical order.  The most significant to users familiar with Ada 83 is
that chapter 14 on input-output has been moved into the annex on the
predefined environment where it logically belongs.  The annexes have
themselves been reordered so that the mandatory annexes on the predefined
environment and interfacing to other languages come first, followed by
the six specialized needs annexes, the obsolescent features and then
finally the non-normative annexes summarizing attributes and so on.

<h2>
<a name=1>
Y.1  Core Language
</a>
</h2>

<dl>
<dt>  
Trailing underlines
<dd>
<p>     
Trailing underlines are not allowed in identifiers whereas they were in
the Committee Draft.  Reversion to the Ada 83 rule was deemed appropriate
because allowing just trailing underlines did not achieve the flexibility
desired for wide compatibility with other languages such as C.
Permitting leading underlines and multiple embedded underlines would have
given greater compatibility but was considered unacceptable given the
strength of concern for readability of program text.  (2.1)
</p>
<dt>
Modular types
<dd>
<p>     
Modular types are no longer described in terms of principal values and
secondary values; they just have a value.  A consequence is that
conversion to and from integer types always preserves the numerical value
or raises Constraint_Error.  Wraparound on conversion no longer occurs.
(3.3.2)
</p>
<dt>
Extension aggregates
<dd>
<p>     
The ancestor part can now be a subtype name as an alternative to an
expression.  This enables an extension aggregate to be written even when
the ancestor is abstract such as in the case of controlled types.
(3.6.1, 7.4)
</p>
<dt>
Controlled types
<dd>
<p>     
The package Ada.Finalization is restructured.  The types Controlled and
Limited_Controlled are no longer derived from types in the package
System.Implementation (which no longer exists) but are simply abstract
private types.  The previous problem with writing aggregates for types
derived from abstract types is now overcome by the new form of extension
aggregate mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
   The procedure Split is now called Adjust.  The procedures Adjust and
Finalize are no longer abstract but have null bodies like Initialize.
(7.4)
</p>
<dt>
Task storage size
<dd>
<p>     
The new pragma Storage_Size permits setting the storage size for
individual tasks of a task type.  This pragma is placed in the task
specification and could thus depend on the value of a task discriminant.
It replaces the use of an attribute definition clause for setting
Storage_Size which gave the same attribute value to all tasks of the
type.  (9.6)
</p>
<dt>
Children of generic units
<dd>
<p>     
It is no longer necessary for a child of a generic unit to be
instantiated as a child of an instantiation of its parent.  This
requirement of the CD and DIS caused problems for many applications and a
child can now be instantiated anywhere provided the generic child is
visible.  (10.1.3)
</p>
<dt>
Exception occurrences
<dd>
<p>     
The package Ada.Exceptions is significantly restructured.  The generic
child Ada.Exceptions.Messages has been deleted.  The ability to attach a
user message to the raising of an exception can now be done more flexibly
using the procedure Raise_Occurrence and the new attribute Identity.  A
major advantage is that exceptions so raised do not all have the same
name Exception_With_Message.
</p>
<p>
   The type Exception_Occurrence is now limited so that occurrences
cannot be directly assigned.  Exceptions can now be saved by a procedure
and function Save_Occurrence.  This approach overcomes implementation
problems associated with the size of saved information.  (11.2)
</p>
<dt>
Access in generic bodies
<dd>
<p>     
The Access attribute can now be applied to objects in generic bodies when
the access type is external.  The associated accessibility check is
dynamic and raises Program_Error if it fails.  This gives greater
flexibility in the use of generics.  Note that the Access attribute still
cannot be applied to subprograms in generic bodies when the access type
is external.  (12.3)
</p>
<dt>
Alignment and Size attributes
<dd>
<p>
     The rules regarding these attributes have been somewhat changed.  They
can now only be applied to first subtypes (and objects) and not to all
subtypes.  Furthermore the Address must be a multiple of the Alignment.
(13.1)

<dl>
<dt>
Package Characters
<dd>
<p>     
This has been slightly restructured.  The classification and conversion
functions are now in a child package Characters.Handling and the package
Characters is itself empty (other than the pragma Pure).  The reason for
this change is so that the child Characters.Latin_1 can be used without
introducing any unnecessary executable code from its parent.  A related
change is that the package Standard.ASCII is now obsolescent; programmers
are expected to use Characters.Latin_1 instead.  (A.1)
</p>
<dt>
Import and Export
<dd>
<p>     
The pragmas Import and Export now have a fourth parameter.  The third
parameter now gives the name of the entity in the other language and the
fourth parameter gives the link name.  (B.1)
</p>
<dt>
Text_IO
<dd>
<p>
A number of improvements have been made to Text_IO.
</p>
<p>
   The concept of an error output stream has been added in line with
facilities in many operating systems.  Subprograms enable the error
stream to be manipulated in a manner similar to the default output
stream.
</p>
<p>
   The functions Current_Input, Current_Output and Current_Error are
overloaded with versions returning an access value.  This enables the
current stream to be preserved for later use in a more flexible manner.
</p>
<p>
   The procedure Get_Immediate provides immediate non-buffered and non-
blocking input; this is useful for interactive applications.
</p>
<p>
   The procedure Look_Ahead returns the next character without removing
it; this enables the user to write procedures which behave in a similar
manner to the predefined procedures Get for integer and real types.
</p>
<p>
   The procedure Get for real types will now accept a literal in more
liberal formats; leading and trailing digits around the radix point are
not required and indeed the point itself may be omitted.  This enables
data produced by programs written in languages such as Fortran to be
processed directly.
</p>
<p>
   The procedure Flush is added; this outputs the contents of the current
buffer.
</p>
<p>
   Nongeneric packages equivalent to instantiations of Integer_IO and
Float_IO with the predefined types have been added since the DIS.  These
will be found of considerable benefit for teaching Ada since simple
input-output of numbers can now be performed without the introduction of
genericity.  (A.4)
</p>
<dt>
Command line
<dd>
<p>     
The package Ada.Command_Line enables a program to access the commands and
parameters of the command line interpreter if any.  It also enables a
program to set its result status.  (A.5)
</p>
<dt>
Random number generator
<dd>
<p>
The package Ada.Numerics.Random_Numbers has been considerably
restructured and renamed as Ada.Numerics.Float_Random.  The additional
generic package Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random produces streams of random
discrete values.  (A.3)
</p>

Edited output
<dd>
<p>
     The package Ada.Text_IO.Pictures is now called Ada.Text_IO.Editing.  The
description has been recast to avoid dependence on the COBOL standard.
(F.2)
