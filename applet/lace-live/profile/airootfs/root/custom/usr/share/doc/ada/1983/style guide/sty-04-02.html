Ada's ability to enforce information hiding and separation of concerns through  
its visibility controlling features is one of the most important advantages of  
the language, particularly when &quot;pieces of a large system are being developed 
separately.&quot; Subverting these features, for example by excessive reliance on  
the use clause, is wasteful and dangerous. See also <a href="sty-05-07.html#5.7">Guideline 5.7</a>.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
For each entity in the specification, give careful consideration to whether it 
could be moved to the body. The fewer the extraneous details, the more 
understandable the program, package, or subprogram. It is important to 
maintainers to know exactly what a package interface is so that they can 
understand the effects of changes. Interfaces to a subprogram extend beyond 
the parameters. Any modification of global data from within a package or 
subprogram is an undocumented interface to the &quot;outside&quot; as well.<P>
Pushing as many as possible of the context dependencies into the body makes 
the reader's job easier, localizes the recompilation required when library 
units change, and helps prevent a ripple effect during modifications. See also 
<a href="#4.2.3">Guideline 4.2.3</a>.<P>
Subprograms with large numbers of parameters often indicate poor design 
decisions (e.g., the functional boundaries of the subprogram are 
inappropriate, or parameters are structured poorly). Conversely, subprograms 
with no parameters are likely to be accessing global data.<P>
Objects visible within package specifications can be modified by any unit that 
has visibility to them. The object cannot be protected or represented 
abstractly by its enclosing package. Objects which must persist should be 
declared in package bodies. Objects whose value depends on program units 
external to their enclosing package are probably either in the wrong package 
or are better accessed by a subprogram specified in the package specification.

<H4>note</H4>
The specifications of some packages, such as Ada bindings to existing  
subroutine libraries, cannot easily be reduced in size. In such cases, it may  
be beneficial to break these up into smaller packages, grouping according to  
category (e.g., trigonometric functions).<P>

<H3><BR><a name="4.2.2">4.2.2   Nested Packages</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Nest package specifications within another package specification only  
for grouping operations, hiding common implementation details, or presenting  
different views of the same abstraction.
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-14.html">Chapter 14</a> of the <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual</a>  gives an example of desirable  
package specification nesting. The specifications of generic packages  
<CODE>Integer_IO</CODE>, <CODE>Float_IO</CODE>, <CODE>Fixed_IO</CODE>, and <CODE>Enumeration_IO</CODE> are nested within the  
specification of package <CODE>Text_IO</CODE>. Each of them is a generic, grouping closely  
related operations and needing to use hidden details of the implementation of  
<CODE>Text_IO</CODE>.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Grouping package specifications into an encompassing package emphasizes a  
relationship of commonality among those packages. It also allows them to share  
common implementation details resulting from the relationship.<P>
An abstraction occasionally needs to present different views to different  
classes of users. Building one view upon another as an additional abstraction  
does not always suffice, because the functionality of the operations presented  
by the views may be only partially disjoint. Nesting specifications groups the  
facilities of the various views, yet associates them with the abstraction they  
present. Abusive mixing of the views by another unit would be easy to detect  
due to the multiple use clauses or an incongruous mix of qualified names.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Restricting visibility of a program unit ensures that the program unit is not 
called from some other part of the system than that which was intended. This 
is done by nesting it inside of the only unit which uses it, or by hiding it 
inside of a package body rather than declaring it in the package 
specification.  This avoids errors and eases the job of maintainers by 
guaranteeing that a local change in that unit will not have an unforeseen 
global effect.<P>
Restricting visibility of a library unit, by using with clauses on subunits  
rather than on the entire parent unit, is useful in the same way. In the  
example above, it is clear that the package <CODE>Text_IO</CODE> is used only by the  
<CODE>Listing_Facilities</CODE> package of the compiler.

<H4>note</H4>
One way to minimize the coverage of a <CODE>with</CODE> clause is to use it only with  
subunits that really need it. Consider making those subunits separate  
compilation units when the need for visibility to a library unit is restricted  
to a subprogram or two.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
The decision whether to declare a task in the specification or body of an  
enclosing package is not a simple one. There are good arguments for both.<P>
Hiding a task specification in a package body and exporting (via subprograms) 
only required entries reduces the amount of extraneous information in the 
package specification. It allows your subprograms to enforce any order of 
entry calls necessary to the proper operation of the tasks. It also allows you 
to impose defensive task communication practices (see <a href="sty-06-02.html#6.2.2">Guideline 6.2.2</a>) and proper 
use of conditional and timed entry calls. Finally, it allows the grouping of 
entries into sets for export to different classes of users (e.g., producers 
versus consumers), or the concealment of entries that should not be made 
public at all (e.g., initialization, completion, signals). Where performance 
is an issue and there are no ordering rules to enforce, the entries can be 
renamed as subprograms to avoid the overhead of an extra procedure call.<P>
An argument which can be viewed as an advantage or disadvantage is that hiding  
the task specification in a package body hides the fact of a tasking  
implementation from the user. If the application is such that a change to or  
from a tasking implementation, or a reorganization of services among tasks,  
need not concern users of the package then this is an advantage. However, if  
the package user must know about the tasking implementation to reason about  
global tasking behavior, then it is better not to hide the task completely.  
Either move it to the package specification or add comments stating that there  
is a tasking implementation, describing when a call may block, etc. Otherwise,  
it is the package implementor's responsibility to ensure that users of the  
package do not have to concern themselves with behaviors such as deadlock,  
starvation, and race conditions.<P>
Finally, keep in mind that hiding tasks behind a procedural interface prevents 
the usage of conditional and timed entry calls and entry families, unless you 
add parameters and extra code to the procedures to make it possible for 
callers to direct the procedures to use these capabilities.<P>
