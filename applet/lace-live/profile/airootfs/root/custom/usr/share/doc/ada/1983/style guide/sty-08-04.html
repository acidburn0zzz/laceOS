<H2>CHAPTER 8: Reusability</H2>

<H3><a name="8.4">8.4     Independence</a></H3>
A reusable part should be as independent as possible from other reusable 
parts.  A potential user is less inclined to reuse a part if that part 
requires the use of other parts which seem unnecessary. The &quot;extra baggage&quot; of 
the other parts wastes time and space. A user would like to be able to reuse 
only that part which is perceived as useful.<P>
Note that the concept of a &quot;part&quot; is intentionally vague here. A single 
package does not need to be independent of each other package in a reuse 
library, if the &quot;parts&quot; from that library which are typically reused are 
entire subsystems.  If the entire subsystem is perceived as providing a useful 
function, the entire subsystem is reused. However, the subsystem should not be 
tightly coupled to all the other subsystems in the reuse library, so that it 
is difficult or impossible to reuse the subsystem without reusing the entire 
library. Coupling between reusable parts should only occur when it provides a 
strong benefit perceptible to the user.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Minimize <CODE>with</CODE> clauses on reusable parts, especially on their  
specifications. 
<li>Use generic parameters instead of <CODE>with</CODE> statements to reduce the number  
of context clauses on a reusable part. 
<li> Use generic parameters instead of <CODE>with</CODE> statements to import portions 
of a package rather than the entire package. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
A procedure like the following:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
with Package_A; 
procedure Produce_And_Store_A is 
   ...
   
begin  -- Produce_And_Store_A 
   ... 
   Package_A.Produce (...);
   
   ... 
   Package_A.Store (...);
   
   ... 
end Produce_And_Store_A; 
------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
can be rewritten as a generic unit:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
generic

   with procedure Produce (...); 
   with procedure Store   (...);
   
procedure Produce_And_Store;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
procedure Produce_And_Store is 
   ...
   
begin  -- Produce_And_Store 
   ... 
   Produce (...);
   
   ... 
   Store   (...);
   
   ... 
end Produce_And_Store; 
------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
and then instantiated:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
with Package_A; 
with Produce_And_Store; 
procedure Produce_And_Store_A is 
        new Produce_And_Store (Produce =&gt; Package_A.Produce, 
                               Store   =&gt; Package_A.Store); 
------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Context (<CODE>with</CODE>) clauses specify the names of other units upon which this unit 
depends. Such dependencies cannot and should not be entirely avoided, but it 
is a good idea to minimize the number of them which occur in the specification 
of a unit. Try to move them to the body, leaving the specification independent 
of other units so that it is easier to understand in isolation. Also, organize 
your reusable parts in such a way that the bodies of the units do not contain 
large numbers of dependencies on each other. Partitioning your library into 
independent functional areas with no dependencies spanning the boundaries of 
the areas is a good way to start. Finally, reduce dependencies by using 
generic formal parameters instead of <CODE>with</CODE> statements, as shown in the example 
above. If the units in a library are too tightly coupled, then no single part 
can be reused without reusing most or all of the library.<P>
The first (nongeneric) version of <CODE>Produce_And_Store_A</CODE> above is difficult to 
reuse because it depends on <CODE>Package_A</CODE> which may not be general purpose or 
generally available. If the operation <CODE>Produce_And_Store</CODE> has reuse potential 
which is reduced by this dependency, a generic unit and an instantiation 
should be produced as shown above. Note that the with clause for <CODE>Package_A</CODE> has 
been moved from the <CODE>Produce_And_Store</CODE> generic procedure which encapsulates the 
reusable algorithm to the <CODE>Produce_And_Store_A</CODE> instantiation. Instead of naming 
the package which provides the required operations, the generic unit simply 
lists the required operations themselves. This increases the independence and 
reusability of the generic unit.<P>
This use of generic formal parameters in place of with clauses also allows 
visibility at a finer granularity. The with clause on the nongeneric version 
of <CODE>Produce_And_Store_A</CODE> makes <u>all</u> of the contents of <CODE>Package_A</CODE> visible to 
<CODE>Produce_And_Store_A</CODE>, while the generic parameters on the generic version make 
only the <CODE>Produce</CODE> and <CODE>Store</CODE> operations available to the generic instantiation.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>For nongenerics named in a context clause, avoid pragma <CODE>Elaborate</CODE>. 
<li>Use pragma <CODE>Elaborate</CODE> for generics named in a context clause. 
<li>Avoid pragma <CODE>Priority</CODE> in tasks hidden in reusable parts.

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------
generic
   ...
   
package Stack is  
   ...
   
end Stack;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pragma Elaborate (Stack); -- in case the body is not yet elaborated

        new Stack (...);

<H4>rationale</H4>
Pragma <CODE>Elaborate</CODE> controls the order of elaboration of one unit with respect to <BR>
another. This is another way of coupling units and should be avoided when <BR>
possible in reusable parts, because it restricts the number of configurations <BR>
in which the reusable parts can be combined.<P>
However, as more compilers begin to allow generics to be instantiated before <BR>
the bodies are compiled, elaboration orders that generally follow compilation <BR>
order may result in program errors.  By forcing the compiler to elaborate the <BR>
generic before the instantiation, this error can be avoided or possibly <BR>
identify a problem of circularity
(see <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-10-05.html">10.5 of Department of Defense 1983</a>).<P>
Pragma <CODE>Priority</CODE> controls the priority of a task relative to all other tasks in<BR>
a particular system. It is inappropriate in a reusable part which does not<BR>
know anything about the requirements and importance of other parts of the<BR>
systems in which it is reused. Give careful consideration to a reusable part<BR>
which claims that it can only be reused if its embedded task has the highest<BR>
priority in the system. No two such parts can ever be used together.

<H4>note</H4>
It is not possible to parameterize tasks with a priority to be specified at <BR>
instantiation or elaboration.  However, a library of reusable parts that <BR>
contain tasks can be designed to depend on a single package of named numbers.  <BR>
These named numbers can then be easily updated to fit the application's need <BR>
with the simple procedure of recompiling any library units that depend on the <BR>
named numbers.  The configuration management implications of such an approach <BR>
are heavily dependent on the Ada development environment and compilation <BR>
system.<P>

<H3><BR><a name="8.4.3">8.4.3   Part Families</a></H3>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Create families of generic or other parts with similar specifications. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
The Booch parts (Booch 1987) are an example of the application of this  
guideline.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Different versions of similar parts (e.g., bounded versus unbounded stacks) 
may be needed for different applications or to change the properties of a 
given application. Often, the different behaviors required by these versions 
cannot be obtained using generic parameters. Providing a family of parts with 
similar specifications makes it easy for the programmer to select the 
appropriate one for the current application or to substitute a different one 
if the needs of the application change.

<H4>note</H4>
A reusable part which is structured from subparts which are members of part  
families is particularly easy to tailor to the needs of a given application by  
substitution of family members.<P>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Some compilers omit object code corresponding to parts of the program which 
they detect can never be executed. Constant expressions in conditional 
statements take advantage of this feature where it is available, providing a 
limited form of conditional compilation. When a part is reused in an 
implementation that does not support this form of conditional compilation, 
this practice produces a clean structure which is easy to adapt by deleting or 
commenting out redundant code where it creates an unacceptable overhead.<P>
This feature should be used when other factors prevent the code from being 
separated into separate subunits.  In the above example, it would be 
preferable to have a different procedure for each algorithm.  But the 
algorithms may differ in slight but complex ways so as to make separate 
procedures difficult to maintain.

<H4>caution</H4>
Be aware of whether your implementation supports dead code removal, and be  
prepared to take other steps to eliminate the overhead of redundant code if  
necessary.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Write table-driven reusable parts where possible and appropriate. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
The epitome of table-driven reusable software is a parser generation system. A 
specification of the form of the input data and of its output, along with some  
specialization code, is converted to tables that are to be &quot;walked&quot; by 
pre-existing code using predetermined algorithms in the parser produced. Other 
forms of &quot;application generators&quot; work similarly.

<H4>rationale</H4>
Table-driven (sometimes known as data-driven) programs have behavior that 
depends on data <CODE>with</CODE>'ed at compile time or read from a file at run-time. In 
appropriate circumstances, table-driven programming provides a very powerful 
way of creating general-purpose, easily tailorable, reusable parts.

<H4>note</H4>
Consider whether differences in the behavior of a general-purpose part could be 
defined by some data structure at compile- or run-time and, if so, structure 
the part to be table-driven. The approach is most likely to be applicable when 
a part is designed for use in a particular application domain but needs to be  
specialized for use in a specific application within the domain. Take  
particular care in commenting the structure of the data needed to drive the  
part.
