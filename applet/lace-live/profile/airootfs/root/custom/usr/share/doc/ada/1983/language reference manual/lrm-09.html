<H1><A NAME="9">9</A>.  Tasks   </H1>
<P>
The execution of a program that does not contain a task is defined in terms
of a sequential execution of its actions, according to the rules  described
in  other  chapters  of this manual.  These actions can be considered to be
executed by a single logical processor. 
<P>
Tasks are entities whose executions proceed in parallel  in  the  following
sense.   Each  task can be considered to be executed by a logical processor
of  its  own.   Different  tasks  (different  logical  processors)  proceed
independently, except at points where they synchronize. 
<P>
Some  tasks have entries.  An entry of a task can be called by other tasks.
A task accepts a call  of  one  of  its  entries  by  executing  an  accept
statement for the entry.  Synchronization is achieved by rendezvous between
a  task  issuing an entry call and a task accepting the call.  Some entries
have parameters;  entry calls and accept statements for  such  entries  are
the principal means of communicating values between tasks. 
<P>
The  properties of each task are defined by a corresponding task unit which
consists of a task specification and a task body.  Task units  are  one  of
the  four  forms  of  program  unit of which programs can be composed.  The
other forms are subprograms, packages and generic units.  The properties of
task units,  tasks,  and  entries,  and  the  statements  that  affect  the
interaction   between   tasks  (that  is,  entry  call  statements,  accept
statements, delay statements, select statements, and abort statements)  are
described in this chapter.
<P>
Note: 
<P>
Parallel   tasks  (parallel  logical  processors)  may  be  implemented  on
multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved execution on a  single
physical  processor.   On  the  other  hand, whenever an implementation can 
detect that the same effect can be guaranteed if parts of the actions of  a
given  task  are  executed  by  different  physical  processors  acting  in
parallel, it may choose to execute them in  this  way;   in  such  a  case,
several physical processors implement a single logical processor.
