<H2>CHAPTER 8: Subprograms</H2>

<H3><a name="8.2">8.2 Parameter Modes</a></H3>

In a  subprogram call,  each formal  parameter is  associated  with  a
corresponding actual  parameter. Actions  performed by  the subprogram
body on  a formal  parameter will  result at  the place of the call in
actions on  the associated  actual parameter:  Thus a formal parameter
may permit  reading the  value of  the  associated  actual  parameter,
updating this  value, or  both. Such  reading and  updating rights are
specified by the mode of the formal parameter.
<p>
Three parameter  modes are  provided in Ada: they are the modes in, in
out, and  out. The  properties of  formal parameters  of each of these
modes are  summarized in  the table  given below.  The  second  column
indicates the  nature of  the formal  parameter: constant or variable.
The third column indicates the reading and updating rights:
<p>

<p>
This  definition  of  parameter  modes  offers  an  abstract  view  of
parameter passing.  It can  be expressed  as a  contract regarding the
data flow between the caller and the subprogram:
<p>

<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=6><tr><th align=left>Mode</th><th align=left>Requirement</th></tr>

The subprogram must return a value

The subprogram must return a value
</pre></td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table></tr></table></center>
<p>
In principle,  two different  mechanisms can be used to implement this
abstract view of parameter passing.
<p>
The first  possibility is  parameter passing  by copy. At the start of
each call,  copy the value of the actual parameter into the associated
formal parameter,  if the  mode is  in or  in out.  Then, after normal
completion of  the subprogram  body, copy  the  value  of  the  formal
parameter back into the associated actual parameter, if the mode is in
out or out.
<p>
The second  possibility, called  parameter passing by reference, is to
arrange that,  throughout the  execution of  the subprogram call, each
reading or  updating of  the formal parameter is treated as reading or
updating of the associated actual parameter.
<p>
The problems  associated with  each of  these mechanisms  are reviewed
first, and then the Ada solution is presented.

<H3><BR><a name="8.2.1">8.2.1 Efficiency Issues of Parameter Passing Mechanisms</a></H3>

Which of  the two  mechanisms of parameter passing (by reference or by
copy) is  more efficient  depends on  the case  considered. For  large
objects, the  by-reference mechanism  is often  more efficient. On the
other hand, for objects that are smaller than the storage units of the
target machine,  copy will usually be more efficient. Furthermore copy
may be the only possible mechanism between different addressing spaces
in distributed systems.
<p>
The problem  of reference to small objects is indeed severe and may be
illustrated by the problem of reading and updating parameters that are
boolean components  of records. Although such components have the same
type (BOOLEAN) there is no guarantee that they will always be found in
the same bit position within a record.
<p>
Achieving parameter passing by reference would then require that, with
each boolean  formal parameter,  there be  an implicit  subprogram  (a
thunk) for  reading the  value of  the corresponding actual parameter;
and similarly,  another thunk  for updating.  This is somewhat complex
and inefficient.
<p>
Some languages,  such as  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>, have  tried to  avoid the problem by
forbidding the  association of  a formal  reference parameter  with an
actual that  is a  component of  a packed  record  or  array;  and  by
adopting otherwise  a unique  default  representation  for  all  small
objects: one  addressable storage  unit per  small  object  (even  for
boolean components).  The problem  with this solution is that, for all
practical purposes,  it would  force programmers to use representation
clauses in  too many  cases: the  default representation chosen by the
compiler would  often be  too costly,  except on  machines with  small
storage units. Moreover, this restriction would mean that the legality
of a program would depend on the presence or absence of representation
clauses or packing pragmas, which Ada avoids (see <a href="ratl-15.html#15">Chapter 15</a>).
<p>
A further  problem arises  with parameter  passing by  reference  with
respect to  the checking  of constraints.  To illustrate  the  problem
consider the following declarations:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
subtype NATURAL is INTEGER range 0 .. INTEGER'LAST;  -- predefined
SUM :  NATURAL  :=  200;
...
procedure REDUCE(AMOUNT :  in out INTEGER) is
  DECREMENT :  NATURAL;
begin
  -- compute DECREMENT
  ...
  AMOUNT :=  AMOUNT - DECREMENT;  -- (1)
  if AMOUNT &lt; 0 then
    AMOUNT :=  0;
  end if;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Now consider the procedure call statement
<p>
<PRE>    REDUCE(SUM);</PRE>
<p>
If parameter  passing were  by reference,  it would not be possible to
complete the  assignment at  (1)  in  the  case  where  AMOUNT  became
negative, since  it would  violate the  constraint on  SUM; hence  the
exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR  would have to be raised by this statement.
This, however, would require passing range constraint information as a
run-time descriptor  for such procedure calls, in order to allow these
constraint checks  within the  procedure body.  Alternatively,  if  we
assume that  the constraint applicable to the formal parameter is that
specified by the subtype of the formal parameter, then by-reference is
not possible and all parameter passing must be by copy.

<H3><BR><a name="8.2.2">8.2.2 The Effect of Parameter Passing Mechanisms for Access Types</a></H3>

A difficulty  of a  different nature  arises for  parameter passing by
reference in  the  case  of  access  types.  Consider  for  example  a
procedure to delete a given element from a list (see <a href="ratl-06-03.html#6.3.6">section 6.3.6</a>):
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PLACE;
type LIST is access PLACE;

type PLACE is
  record
    SUCC     :  LIST;
    PRED     :  LIST;
    CONTENT  :  ITEM;
  end record;
...

E :  LIST;
procedure DELETE(L :  in LIST) is
begin
  L.SUCC.PRED    :=  L.PRED;
  L.PRED.SUCC    :=  L.SUCC;
  L.SUCC     :=  null;
  L.PRED     :=  null;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
This is  the conventional  way of  deleting an  element from a doubly-
linked list, and a call such as
<p>
<PRE>    DELETE(X);</PRE>
<p>
will work  regardless of  whether parameter  passing  is  achieved  by
reference or by copy. Consider however the procedure call
<p>
<PRE>    DELETE(E.PRED);</PRE>
<p>
where we assume the list to be in the following state before the call:
<p><pre>
   place:          A     B     C     D     E     F
   successor:      B     C     D     E     F     ...
   predecessor:    ...   A     B     C     D     E
</pre><p>
If parameter  passing is  by copy,  we achieve  the desired  effect of
deleting D (the predecessor of E) and we obtain the state
<p><pre>
   place:          A     B     C     D     E     F
   successor:      B     C     E     null  F     ...
   predecessor:    ...   A     B     null  C     E
</pre><p>
If parameter passing is by reference, then the formal parameter L will
refer to  the object  E.PRED.  The  first  assignment  will  have  the
expected effect  of establishing  E.PRED =  C. But this means that the
remaining statements  will operate  on C  (rather than D) and will not
achieve what  we want:  the second assignment will achieve B.SUCC = D;
and the  last two  assignments will  unlink C (rather than D), leaving
the list in a state of chaos:
<p><pre>
   place:          A     B     C     D     E     F
   successor:      B     D     null  E     F     ...
   predecessor:    ...   A     null  C     C     E
</pre><p>
One possible  reaction to  this example  is to consider that parameter
passing by  reference is  legitimate for access types, and that we are
just confronted  with an incorrect program. Our preferred viewpoint is
rather to  consider that  access types  are already unique in that the
programmer  is  permitted  explicitly  to  manipulate  references  and
construct aliases:  This  is  the  purpose  of  access  types,  and  a
programmer using  such types  is asserting  that  he  wishes  to  take
control of  all references  and aliases.  Accordingly,  the  parameter
passing should  not generate extra references and aliases of which the
programmer is  unaware; therefore,  all parameter  passing for  access
types should be by copy.
<p>
A final  problem with  parameter passing  by reference  is  that  this
mechanism will  be almost  impossible to  achieve (or  at least,  very
costly) on  distributed systems and whenever we deal with systems with
multiple address spaces.

<H3><BR><a name="8.2.3">8.2.3 The Effect of Parameter Passing Mechanisms for Composite Types</a></H3>

In normal  situations the  effect of  a program  does  not  depend  on
whether parameter  passing for  array and record types is by reference
or by  copy. The  only situations where there might be a difference in
effect correspond to:
<ul>
<li>Certain cases  in which  the execution of a subprogram is abandoned
   as a result of an exception.
<p>
<li>Certain cases  in which  there are multiple access paths to a given
   variable.
</ul>

These situations  are reviewed  below. The  subject of multiple access
paths  is   further  subdivided  into  a  discussion  of  aliasing  in
sequential programs,  and a discussion of shared variables in parallel
programs.
<p>
<H4>Exceptions</H4>
<p>
If the  execution of  a subprogram  is abandoned  as the  result of an
exception not  handled locally,  then the  final value  of  an  actual
parameter that  is associated  with a  formal parameter of mode in out
may depend  on the  parameter passing mechanism: If by copy, the final
value will  still  be  the  initial  value  before  the  call.  If  by
reference, the  final value  may be  this initial  value, or any value
assigned  to   the  formal  parameter  during  the  execution  of  the
subprogram (before  the exception  was raised).  In either  case,  the
final value is guaranteed to have the subtype of the actual parameter.
<p>
At the  cost of  more elaborate  run-time treatment  of exceptions, it
would certainly be possible to copy back current values in the case of
termination by  an exception.  But this  complication is not worth the
effort. Consider for example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure P(X :  in out COMPOSITE_TYPE) is
begin
  ...               -- (1)
  X :=  ... ;
  ...               -- (2)
end ;
  ...
P(A);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
If the  execution of  P is abandoned as a result of an exception, then
the caller may obtain information about the nature of the exception by
means of appropriate handlers:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
begin
  P(A);
exception
  when ERROR =&gt;
    -- the exception raised was ERROR
  when CONSTRAINT_ERROR =&gt;
    -- the exception raised was CONSTRAINT_ERROR
  when others =&gt;
    -- the exception raised is other than the above two
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
On the  other hand,  the caller  does not  usually  know  whether  the
exception was  raised during  (1) or (2) or even during the assignment
to the  formal parameter X. Consequently the difference resulting from
choosing a reference rather than a copy mechanism is of the same order
as the uncertainty that already exists about the exact point where the
exception is  raised. In  addition, when  a user writes P(A) where the
parameter mode  is in  out (and even more so if the mode is out), then
he expects the value of A to be changed. So it does not matter much if
this value  is changed during the call or only at the end. If the user
wants to  reuse the  previous value  of  A  in  the  case  that  P  is
terminated by an exception, the only logical way to do so is to assign
its value to another variable before the call.
<p>
Note finally  that if  it is  important to  guarantee that the initial
value is  not modified  if an  exception is  raised, then this is best
achieved by  the procedure  body itself. One possibility is to compute
first whatever  needs to be changed but perform the change itself only
at the  end of the procedure, so that no change occurs if an exception
is raised  before the  end. Another possible style involves the use of
exception handlers for expressing last wishes:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure P(X :  in out COMPOSITE_TYPE) is
begin
  ...
exception
  when others =&gt;
    -- restore initial value of X
    raise;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<H4>Aliasing</H4>
<p>
If aliasing  is used  then the  results may  differ between  reference
implementations and copy implementations. For example consider
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
A  :  STRING(1 .. 8)  :=  "AAAAVVVV";
B  :  STRING(1 .. 12) :=  "111122223333";

procedure MODIFY(S :  in out STRING) is
begin
  if S'LENGTH &gt;=  8 then
    S(S'FIRST .. S'FIRST + 3) :=  "-&#42;&#42;-";
    S(S'FIRST + 4 .. S'FIRST + 7) :=  A(1 .. 4);
  end if;
end;
...
MODIFY(B);      -- leaves B =  "-&#42;&#42;-AAAA3333"
MODIFY(A);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The call  of MODIFY for the string B will deliver the expected result.
Consider however  what happens  when A  is passed as actual parameter.
Since A is referred to directly within the body of MODIFY, we now have
two possible  access paths  to A,  the second  being  via  the  formal
parameter S. In this case of aliasing the effect of the procedure will
depend on the mechanism used for parameter passing: the final value of
A will be "-&#42;&#42;-AAAA" by value, and "-&#42;&#42;--&#42;&#42;-" by reference.
<p>
The same  trick could actually be used (facetiously) to discover which
mechanism is used for parameter passing:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
MODE :  STRING(1 .. 4)  :=  "COPY";
procedure FIND_MECHANISM(S :  in out STRING) is
begin
  MODE :=  "REF  ";
  if S =  "COPY" then
    PUT("MECHANISM IS COPY");
  else
    PUT("MECHANISM IS REFERENCE");
  end if;
end;
...
FIND_MECHANISM(MODE);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
although an implementation is in fact free to use different mechanisms
for different calls.
<p>
In both  examples,  the  effect  obtained  by  reference  is  somewhat
pathological: In  the first  example, normally we would like the first
assignment to S not to affect A and the subsequent assignment to S. So
whereas for  efficiency reasons  we might  prefer an implementation by
reference, the  copy mechanism  provides us  with a  simpler model for
understanding programs and therefore for developing reliable programs.
<p>
Whereas aliasing  between a formal parameter and a global variable may
reasonably be assumed to be unintentional, aliasing is not necessarily
undesirable. In  particular, aliasing between formal parameters may in
many cases  be deliberate. Consider for example a procedure for vector
addition
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure ADD(A :  in out VECTOR;  B :  in VECTOR) is
begin
  if A'FIRST =  B'FIRST and A'LAST = B'LAST then
    for N in A'RANGE loop
      A(N) :=  A(N) + B(N);
    end loop;
  end if;
end;
...
V :  VECTOR(1 .. 100)  :=  ...;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Then for a call such as
<p>
<PRE>    ADD(V, V);</PRE>
<p>
although we  have a  case of aliasing between formal parameters within
the body  of ADD,  since both  A and  B refer  to V, the effect of the
procedure does not depend on whether reference or copy is used for the
implementation of parameter passing.
<p>
To conclude the discussion on this subject it appears that for certain
cases of  aliasing, different  effects will  be obtained for parameter
passing by reference and by copy. These cases, however, represent poor
programming practice,  and do  not provide  a sound basis for deciding
language semantics.
<p>
<H4>Shared Variables</H4>
<p>
The language  rules state that the execution of a program is erroneous
if a  shared variable  that is  updated by  a given  task between  two
synchronization points is also read or updated by another task between
these two synchronization points (hence asynchronously). The effect of
such erroneous  execution is unpredictable. This indeterminacy will be
further revealed  by differences  in the  parameter passing mechanism.
Consider for example
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
SHARED :  COMPOSITE_TYPE; -- a shared variable
...
procedure LIST(X :  in COMPOSITE_TYPE);
...
LIST(SHARED);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The code  of the  procedure LIST will rely on the fact that the formal
parameter is  constant:  in  particular  this  means  that  reading  a
component of the formal parameter at different times and places within
this procedure  must always  yield the  same value.  This is obviously
achieved (whether the actual parameter is a shared variable or not) if
parameter passing  is by  copy. If  however parameter  passing  is  by
reference,  and   the  actual   parameter   is   a   shared   variable
asynchronously updated  by another task, then this invariability is no
longer guaranteed.
<p>
Here again,  the indeterminacy  is inherent in the asynchronous access
to the  shared variable:  it is  further revealed  by  differences  in
parameter passing mechanism, but these differences are not the primary
cause.

<H3><BR><a name="8.2.4">8.2.4 The Ada Solution for Parameter Passing</a></H3>

Before describing the parameter passing mechanisms, consider first the
interpretation of the subtype that is declared for a formal parameter.
<ul>
<li>In the  case of  a scalar  type, the  constraint applicable  to the
   formal parameter  is always  that imposed  by the  subtype  of  the
   formal parameter.
<p>
<li>In the  case of  an array  or record  type, the  constraint on  the
   formal  parameter   is  inherited  from  the  corresponding  actual
   parameter (if the declaration of the formal specifies a constraint,
   then the actual constraint must be the same).
</ul>
In implementation  terms, the above subdivision reflects the fact that
run-time descriptors  for constraints  are never passed to subprograms
in the case of scalar types (see the example AMOUNT in <a href="ratl-08-02.html#8.2.1">section 8.2.1</a>).
On the  other hand  the constraint information is always passed in the
case of composite types:
<ul>
<li>For arrays,  the bounds  are passed  and can be interrogated within
   subprograms by means of array attributes.
<p>
<li>For records  with discriminants,  the discriminants are part of the
   value. Furthermore,  the value  of  the  CONSTRAINED  attribute  is
   passed.
</ul>

The allowed mechanisms follow from the above considerations.
<ol type=a>
<li>For scalar  types, and  for all  modes, all parameter
   passing must  be achieved  by copy.  The same  treatment applies to
   access types, for the reasons given in the previous section.
<p>
<li>For record  and array  types, the  language does  not
   specify whether  parameter passing  is achieved  by reference or by
   copy. Furthermore,  the execution  of a program is erroneous if its
   effect  depends   on   which   mechanism   is   selected   by   the
   implementation.
</ul>

In normal  situations the  semantics of a program will not be affected
by whether  parameter passing  for composite  types is  implemented by
reference or by copying: We have seen that the indeterminacy resulting
from the  parameter passing  mechanism only  matters  where  there  is
already  a  higher  degree  of  indeterminacy  (shared  variables  and
exceptions) and  where aliasing is used to achieve dubious effects: In
both cases  the language  rules therefore  state that the execution of
the program is erroneous.
<p>
For private types parameter passing is as for the type declared by the
corresponding full  type  declaration.  Finally  for  task  types  the
mechanism never  matters, since  a task  object always  designates the
same task.
<p>
During this  design we  considered, and rejected, several alternatives
to this  abstract formulation  of the  parameter  passing  modes.  For
example, an  implementation-oriented formulation  of  modes  could  be
defined in  terms of  the  mechanisms  involved:  copy  or  reference.
However, if  the same capabilities are to be offered this leads to yet
more modes  (constant by copy, constant by reference, variable by copy
before and  after, variable  by reference,  result by  copy, result by
reference). Although  only a  subset of  them might be provided, it is
critical for reliability and efficiency to be able to pass an array by
reference and  nevertheless deny  the right  to modify its components.
Apart  from  its  complexity,  such  a  formulation  would  force  the
programmer to  think in  terms of (and be aware of) the representation
of objects, and would therefore compromise portability.
<p>
We consider the formulation of the parameter passing modes in, in out,
and out  in terms  of their  abstract behavior  to be much simpler and
therefore preferable.
