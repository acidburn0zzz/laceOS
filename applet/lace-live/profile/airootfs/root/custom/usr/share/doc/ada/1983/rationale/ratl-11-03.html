<H2>CHAPTER 11: General Program Structure - Visibility and Overloading</H2>

<H3><a name="11.3">11.3 Visibility Rules</a></H3>

The visibility  rules provided  in Ada  combine Algol-like inheritance
rules with  an ability  to control  the set  of names that can be used
within  a   given  context.  This  ability  follows  from  the  naming
conventions and  the facilities offered by packages and use clauses. A
renaming capability is also provided.
<p>
We  first   discuss  the  basic  visibility  model,  then  the  naming
conventions, use clauses, and renaming.

<H3><BR><a name="11.3.1">11.3.1 Basic Visibility Model</a></H3>

The search  for simple and uniform scope rules has led to the adoption
of a  traditional approach: an identifier that is declared immediately
within a  given declarative  region is  directly visible  within inner
(nested) declarative regions.
<p>
The term  declarative region  in the above rule refers to a portion of
the program  text which  includes a  major group  of declarations. For
example a  declarative region  is formed  by a  block statement,  by a
subprogram, or by any other program unit (a package, a task unit, or a
generic unit);  similarly a  declarative region  is formed by a record
type declaration. Thus the basic rule is essentially that of <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Algol 60</a>.
The only  extensions to  this rule  are related  to  packages  and  to
separate compilation.
<p>
The fundamental  reason for  selecting this  liberal approach  is  the
pragmatic assumption  that names  declared together are normally meant
to be used together. Consider, for instance, the skeleton:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
procedure P is
  type T is <a href="ratl-00.html#errors"><i>[**error in text - Ed.**]</a></i>. ; -- type declaration
  V :  T;         -- variable declaration
  procedure Q;    -- procedure declaration

  ...

  procedure Q is
    ...
  begin
    ...
  end Q;
begin
  ...
end P;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
It can  be assumed  that the  names T, V and Q are defined in the same
context (the  declarative part  of P)  because they are intended to be
used together  - here  in the  sequence of  statements of P. Extending
this reasoning  to inner  program units  means for  instance that  the
names T,  V, and  possibly Q are also visible within the body of Q, so
that this  body may  be directly defined in terms of these names. This
suggests the  assumption that  entities declared  in the  same context
have mutually dependent definitions.
<p>
One alternative considered was to designate certain program units such
as procedures  and packages as being always closed: Closed units would
not automatically inherit the visibility of outer declarative regions,
so that  some form  of explicit  import directive would be required in
order for  names declared  in outer  regions to  become visible within
closed units.  This was  ultimately deemed unacceptable because it led
to clutter and to long name lists in many common cases.
<p>
The following  example  illustrates  the  useless  redundancy  of  the
directive "sees  T, C,  L", where  the procedures  P_1 through P_N are
obviously meant to work with T, C and L.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
-- the following is not an Ada text

package D is
  type T is ... ;
  C :  constant T  :=  ... ;

  procedure P_1  ( ... );
  procedure P_2  ( ... );
  ...
  procedure P_N( ... );
end D;

package body D is
  L :  T;

  -- note: "sees T, C, L" is not legal in Ada

  procedure P_1( ... )     sees T, C, L is ... end P_1;
  procedure P_2( ... )     sees T, C, L is ... end P_2;
  ...
  procedure P_N( ... )     sees T, C, L is ... end P_N;
end D;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Early experience  with the  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Euclid</a> language, in which such an approach
was taken,  shows that  the danger  of long  name lists  is not  to be
underestimated. Because  of transitivity,  Euclid import lists can get
very long.  The danger is then - as evidenced by experience with named
common in  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Fortran</a> programs  - that  programmers tend  to use the same
import lists  in all program units, for fear of omitting something. In
any case,  long name  lists are usually skipped when reading, and this
defeats their  very  purpose.  The  classical  argument  developed  by
Dijkstra <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[Di  72]</a>, about  our inability to deal with a large number of
entities at  the same  time, also  applies to  long  -  and  therefore
unstructured - name lists.
<p>
The only  way to  avoid this form of text clutter is to make automatic
inheritance the  default  rule.  The  argument  is  that  the  textual
embedding of  declarations is already a strong indication of potential
dependence. The  systematic inclusion  of additional import directives
does not  usually  provide  much  information  that  may  usefully  be
exploited by  the translator,  and it  is likely to distract readers -
and writers - of programs.
<p>
It was found, moreover, that whether a given syntactic category should
be an  open scope  or a closed scope was a highly subjective question.
The answer  may vary from one use to another, depending on the size of
a particular  program unit,  the depth  to which  it  is  nested,  the
probability of subsequent recompilation, and so on.
<p>
It seems  clear, therefore, that the syntax of the language should not
arbitrarily impose  a decision in this regard. For this reason we have
adopted the following approach:
<ul>
<li>All  syntactic  constructs  that  introduce  declarations  normally
   inherit the identifiers of outer (enclosing) contexts.
<p>
<li>A set  of declarations can be encapsulated in the visible part of a
   package: the  visibility of  these declarations is then acquired in
   other contexts by means of use clauses.
</ul>

<H3><BR><a name="11.3.2">11.3.2 Naming Conventions: Expanded Names and Use Clauses</a></H3>

Since classical  inheritance of  identifiers  from  outer  declarative
regions is the default rule, redeclaration of identifiers is possible,
with the  effect of  hiding the  outer definitions  within  the  inner
region.
<p>
Some of  the difficulties  with identifier redeclarations disappear if
the names  of the  corresponding entities  can be  written as expanded
names: using  the dot  notation. Consider,  for example,  the  type  T
declared immediately within the procedure P above, and assume that the
same identifier were reused for a declaration given within the body of
Q. The  type name  could still  be written  as P.T  in the  inner unit
(exploiting the  fact that  the identifier  P is  visible there); this
expanded type  name may  thus be  used in  qualified  expressions  and
wherever the need to denote the type arises.
<p>
The use  of expanded  names is  also the  general rule for denoting an
identifier declared  within a  package, when  outside of  the  package
itself. Thus,  outside the  package SIMPLE_IO,  the identifier  CREATE
declared in  the visible  part of  this package  can be denoted by the
expanded name  SIMPLE_IO.CREATE, in  spite of  the fact that CREATE is
not directly visible there.
<p>
As an additional syntactic convenience, a use clause may be given in a
declarative part.  A use  clause mentions  the names  of one  or  more
packages and  its effect  is  to  achieve  direct  visibility  of  any
identifier declared  in the  visible part  of  one  of  the  packages,
exactly as if the identifier were declared at the place of the package
concerned. For  a given  identifier,  however,  this  effect  is  only
achieved in the absence of any conflicting identifier. For example, in
a region that includes the use clause
<p>
<PRE>    use D, E;</PRE>
<p>
the identifier  I is  an acceptable abbreviation for D.I provided that
this identifier  is declared  in D and is not hidden by an intervening
redeclaration of  I, and  provided also  that the  package E  does not
contain an  identifier  I  in  its  visible  part.  In  all  cases  of
redeclaration or conflict, the intended name must be given in full, as
an expanded name.
<p>
These rules are illustrated by the following example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package D is
   T, U, V :  BOOLEAN;
end D;
                                   -- (1)
procedure P is
                                   -- (2)
  package E is
    B, W, V :  INTEGER;
  end E;
                                   -- (3)
  procedure Q is
    T, X :  REAL;
                                   -- (4)
  begin
    ...
    declare
      use D, E;
    begin
      -- the name T   means Q.T, not D.T
      -- the name U   means D.U
      -- the name B   means E.B
      -- the name W   means E.W
      -- the name X   means Q.X
      -- the name V is illegal:  it must be written either D.V or E.V
      ...
    end;
  end Q;
begin
  ...
end P;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
In deciding  which names are visible within the sequence of statements
of the block statement we apply the following two-step rule:
<ol type=a>
<li>First we  inherit the names declared in outer regions
   and not  redefined. Thus  we inherit the names D and P, the names E
   and Q declared within P, and the names T and X declared within Q.
<p>
<li>Then we  consider  the  entities  that  may  be  made
   directly visible by means of use clauses. In the above example this
   means the  entities that are declared in the visible parts of D and
   E. We  retain names  that appear  in only one of these packages and
   that do  not conflict with a name introduced in the step (a). Hence
   the names retained here are U, B, W.
</ol>

One consequence  of these  rules is  that the  position of use clauses
does not  matter. Thus  the same effect would be achieved in the above
example if  the clause  "use D;"  were given at any of the points (1),
(2), (3),  or (4);  and the  clause "use  E;" were given at any of the
points (3) or (4).
<p>
Another consequence  is that a name that is made directly visible by a
use clause  cannot hide  another name.  This is  quite  essential  for
maintainability reasons.  Assume, for  example, that the specification
of the  package D were modified to include the declaration of some new
entity called  X. This should normally have no effect on the procedure
Q. In  particular, the inner reference to X should retain its previous
meaning  and   should  hence  mean  Q.X  both  before  and  after  the
modification. (Note  that we  have only  reduced the magnitude of this
general problem,  since a  later introduction  of  W  within  D  would
conflict with  the W  of E;  the full  solution  lies  in  maintenance
tools.)
<p>
A  similar   maintainability  argument  led  us  to  reject  a  unique
visibility  rule;   that  is,   a  rule  forbidding  redeclaration  of
identifiers that  were already visible. If redefinition of identifiers
were not allowed, the later introduction of some entity named X in the
declaration list  of P  would force  textual modification  of an inner
procedure such  as Q,  which should  normally be  unaffected  by  this
change.
<p>
Note that use clauses may be viewed as one possible form of the import
directives mentioned  in <a href="#11.3.1">section  11.3.1</a>. However, the items listed in
use clauses  can only  be names  of packages, and the risk of long use
lists is  correspondingly reduced. Naturally, effective modularization
will depend  upon the user writing packages in such a way that related
definitions are in the same packages; related definitions will usually
be required together.

<H3><BR><a name="11.3.3">11.3.3 Visibility Rules for Record Types</a></H3>

A record  type definition  introduces a  new declarative region. Hence
component  identifiers   may  be  freely  chosen.  For  each  selected
component, the  visibility of the corresponding component is opened by
the dot  that follows  the name of the record variable in the selected
component.
<p>
As with  <a href="ratl-BIB.html#languages">Pascal</a>,  variants  within  a  record  do  not  introduce  new
declarative regions. Hence the component names of each variant must be
distinct  from  those  of  every  other  variant,  even  if  they  are
semantically equivalent  as far  as the  programmer is  concerned. The
reason for  not introducing a new declarative region with each variant
can be seen from the following example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type T(COMPACT :  BOOLEAN  :=  TRUE) is
  record
    case COMPACT is
      when TRUE =&gt;  VALUE :  FLOAT;
      when FALSE =&gt;  VALUE :  LONG_FLOAT;  -- illegal redeclaration
    end case;
  end record;

R :  T;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A selected  component such  as R.VALUE  would have  to be treated as a
conditional  expression,   dependent  on  the  discriminant,  possibly
delivering results of alternative types.

<H3><BR><a name="11.3.4">11.3.4 Renaming</a></H3>

A renaming capability is offered in Ada. As an example consider
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
declare
  L :  PERSON renames LEFTMOST_PERSON;
  R :  PERSON renames TO_BE_PROCESSED(NEXT);
begin
  L.AGE :=  L.AGE + 1;
  R.AGE :=  R.AGE - 1;
  if   L.BIRTH &lt; R.BIRTH then
     L.RANK :=  L.RANK + 1;
  else
     R.RANK :=  R.RANK + 1;
  end if;
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The renaming  declarations of  L and R are used to introduce new local
names    for     the    outer     variables    LEFTMOST_PERSON     and
TO_BE_PROCESSED(NEXT). In  the sequence  of statements of the block, L
and R  may be  used as  convenient names  of the  variables that  they
denote. Here the renaming facility is used for purposes similar to the
Pascal with  statement -  as a  convenient alternative  for frequently
used long  names. However,  components of  renamed records  are  still
denoted with  the syntax  of  record  components  so  they  cannot  be
confused with variables bearing the same name as the components.
<p>
In addition  to the  notational advantage, such a renaming declaration
avoids reevaluating  the access  path to  the record variable for each
component  selection,   and  may  allow  more  efficient  code  to  be
generated.
<p>
Renaming declarations  are also  permitted for  subprograms, packages,
and exceptions.  In addition,  subtype declarations  can  be  used  to
achieve the effect of renaming for types:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
function  "&#42;"   (LEFT,  RIGHT   :    VECTOR)  return  REAL  renames DOT_PRODUCT;
procedure READ(V :  out ELEM) renames PROTECTED_VARIABLE.READ;
package TM renames TABLE_MANAGER;
DATA_ERROR :  exception renames IO_EXCEPTIONS.DATA_ERROR;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The ability  to rename  turns out  to be  very convenient when working
with packages  that are developed independently by different groups of
programmers. Being  independently developed,  such packages  may  well
declare the  same  identifiers.  If  later  these  packages  are  both
mentioned by  a use  clause  in  a  given  region,  it  may  often  be
convenient to  resolve name conflicts by renaming rather than by using
dot notation whenever these identifiers appear. For example consider:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package TRAFFIC is
  type COLOR is (RED, AMBER, GREEN);
  ...
end TRAFFIC;

package WATER_COLORS is
  type COLOR is (WHITE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, BROWN);
  ...
end WATER_COLORS;

declare
  use TRAFFIC, WATER_COLORS;
  subtype SIGNAL is TRAFFIC.COLOR;
  subtype TINT is WATER_COLORS.COLOR;
  LIGHT  :  SIGNAL;
  SHADE  :  TINT;
  ...
begin
  ...
end;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The subtypes  SIGNAL and  TINT effectively  rename  the  corresponding
types and  are unambiguous  within the  block, whereas  COLOR would be
ambiguous.
<p>
Because of  the possibility  of overloading,  it will often suffice to
rename  conflicting   type  names:   names  of   subprograms  will  in
consequence  be  resolved  by  the  overloading  rules.  The  renaming
facility can  also be  used to  provide a name more appropriate to the
context of  its use.  For instance,  the author  of a sort routine may
call his  version QUICKSORT2  whereas SORT  may be  better  (and  less
cumbersome) throughout the application.
