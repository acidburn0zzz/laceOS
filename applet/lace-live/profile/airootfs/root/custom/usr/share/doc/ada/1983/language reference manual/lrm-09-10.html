<P>
An  abort  statement  causes  one  or  more  tasks to become abnormal, thus
preventing any further rendezvous with such tasks. 
<pre>
    abort_statement ::= abort task_name {, task_name}; 
</pre>
<P>
The determination of the type of each task name uses the fact that the type
of the name is a task type. 
<P>
For the execution of an abort statement, the given task names are evaluated
in some order that is not defined by the language.  Each  named  task  then
becomes abnormal unless it is already terminated;  similarly, any task that
depends  on  a named task becomes abnormal unless it is already terminated. 
<P>
Any abnormal task whose execution is suspended at an  accept  statement,  a
select  statement,  or  a  delay statement becomes completed;  any abnormal
task whose execution is suspended at an entry call, and that is not yet  in
a corresponding rendezvous, becomes completed and is removed from the entry
queue;   any  abnormal task that has not yet started its activation becomes
completed (and hence also terminated).  This completes the execution of the
abort statement. 
<P>
The completion of any other abnormal task need not happen before completion
of the abort statement.  It must happen no later  than  when  the  abnormal
task  reaches a synchronization point that is one of the following: the end
of its activation;  a point where it causes the activation of another task;
an entry call; the start or the end  of  an  accept  statement;   a  select
statement;   a  delay  statement;   an  exception  handler;   or  an  abort
statement.  If a task that calls an  entry  becomes  abnormal  while  in  a
rendezvous,  its  termination  does not take place before the completion of
the rendezvous (see <a href="lrm-11-05.html#11.5">11.5</a>). 
<P>
The call of an entry of an abnormal task raises the exception TASKING_ERROR
at the place of the call.  Similarly, the exception TASKING_ERROR is raised
for any task that has called an entry of an abnormal  task,  if  the  entry
call  is still queued or if the rendezvous is not yet finished (whether the
entry call is an entry call statement, or  a  conditional  or  timed  entry
call);   the  exception  is  raised  no  later  than  the completion of the   
abnormal task.  The value of the attribute CALLABLE is FALSE for  any  task
that is abnormal (or completed). 
<P>
If  the  abnormal completion of a task takes place while the task updates a
variable, then the value of this variable is undefined.  Example: 
<pre>
    abort USER, TERMINAL.all, POOL(3); 
</pre>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
An abort statement should be  used  only  in  extremely  severe  situations
requiring  unconditional termination.  A task is allowed to abort any task,
including itself.
