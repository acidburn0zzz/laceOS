<DIV Class="paranum">15.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>See also <A HREF="AA-11-6.html">11.6</A> 
which specifies various liberties associated with optimizations in the 
presence of language-defined checks, that could change the external effects 
that might be produced. These alternative external effects are still 
consistent with the standard, since <A HREF="AA-11-6.html">11.6</A> is 
part of the standard.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">15.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note also that we only require &ldquo;<I>an 
appropriate</I> sequence of external interactions&rdquo; rather than 
&ldquo;<I>the same</I> sequence...&rdquo; An optimizer may cause a different 
sequence of external interactions to be produced than would be produced 
without the optimizer, so long as the new sequence still satisfies the 
requirements of the standard. For example, optimization might affect 
the relative rate of progress of two concurrent tasks, thereby altering 
the order in which two external interactions occur.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">15.d/2</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note that <SPAN class="insert2">the Ada 83 RM</SPAN><SPAN class="delete2">&nbsp;RM83</SPAN> 
explicitly mentions the case of an &ldquo;exact effect&rdquo; of a program, 
but since so few programs have their effects defined that exactly, we 
don't even mention this &ldquo;special&rdquo; case. In particular, almost 
any program that uses floating point or tasking has to have some level 
of inexactness in the specification of its effects. And if one includes 
aspects of the timing of the external interactions in the external effect 
of the program (as is appropriate for a real-time language), no &ldquo;exact 
effect&rdquo; can be specified. For example, if two external interactions 
initiated by a single task are separated by a &ldquo;<B>delay</B> 1.0;&rdquo; 
then the language rules imply that the two external interactions have 
to be separated in time by at least one second, as defined by the clock 
associated with the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-9-6.html#S0211">delay_relative_statement</A></SPAN>. 
This in turn implies that the time at which an external interaction occurs 
is part of the characterization of the external interaction, at least 
in some cases, again making the specification of the required &ldquo;exact 
effect&rdquo; impractical.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">16</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">An implementation that conforms to this Standard 
shall support each capability required by the core language as specified. 
In addition, an implementation that conforms to this Standard may conform 
to one or more Specialized Needs Annexes (or to none). Conformance to 
a Specialized Needs Annex means that each capability required by the 
Annex is provided as specified.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">16.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The last sentence defines 
what it means to say that an implementation conforms to a Specialized 
Needs Annex, namely, only by supporting all capabilities required by 
the Annex.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">17</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">An implementation conforming to this International 
Standard may provide additional attributes, library units, and pragmas. 
However, it shall not provide any attribute, library unit, or pragma 
having the same name as an attribute, library unit, or pragma (respectively) 
specified in a Specialized Needs Annex unless the provided construct 
is either as specified in the Specialized Needs Annex or is more limited 
in capability than that required by the Annex. A program that attempts 
to use an unsupported capability of an Annex shall either be identified 
by the implementation before run time or shall raise an exception at 
run time.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">17.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The last sentence of the 
preceding paragraph defines what an implementation is allowed to do when 
it does not &quot;conform&quot; to a Specialized Needs Annex. In particular, 
the sentence forbids implementations from providing a construct with 
the same name as a corresponding construct in a Specialized Needs Annex 
but with a different syntax (e.g., an extended syntax) or quite different 
semantics. The phrase concerning &quot;more limited in capability&quot; 
is intended to give permission to provide a partial implementation, such 
as not implementing a subprogram in a package or having a restriction 
not permitted by an implementation that conforms to the Annex. For example, 
a partial implementation of the package Ada.Decimal might have Decimal.Max_Decimal_Digits 
as 15 (rather than the required 18). This allows a partial implementation 
to grow to a fully conforming implementation.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">17.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">A restricted implementation might be restricted 
by not providing some subprograms specified in one of the packages defined 
by an Annex. In this case, a program that tries to use the missing subprogram 
will usually fail to compile. Alternatively, the implementation might 
declare the subprogram as abstract, so it cannot be called. {<I>Program_Error 
(raised by failure of run-time check)</I>} <A NAME="I1067"></A>Alternatively, 
a subprogram body might be implemented just to raise Program_Error. The 
advantage of this approach is that a program to be run under a fully 
conforming Annex implementation can be checked syntactically and semantically 
under an implementation that only partially supports the Annex. Finally, 
an implementation might provide a package declaration without the corresponding 
body, so that programs can be compiled, but partitions cannot be built 
and executed.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">17.c</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">To ensure against wrong answers being delivered 
by a partial implementation, implementers are required to raise an exception 
when a program attempts to use an unsupported capability and this can 
be detected only at run time. For example, a partial implementation of 
Ada.Decimal might require the length of the Currency string to be 1, 
and hence, an exception would be raised if a subprogram were called in 
the package Edited_Output with a length greater than 1.&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV Class="paranum">18.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>We used to use the term &ldquo;implementation 
dependent&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo;. However, that 
sounded too much like &ldquo;implementation defined&rdquo;. Furthermore, 
the term &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo; is used in the ANSI C and POSIX standards 
for this purpose, so that is another advantage. We also use &ldquo;not 
specified&rdquo; and &ldquo;not specified by the language&rdquo; as synonyms 
for &ldquo;unspecified.&rdquo; The documentation requirement is the only 
difference between implementation defined and unspecified.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">18.b</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations">Note that the &ldquo;set of possible effects&rdquo;

<DIV Class="paranum">19.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>For example, if the standard 
says that library unit elaboration order is implementation defined, the 
implementation might describe (in its user's manual) the algorithm it 
uses to determine the elaboration order. On the other hand, the implementation 
might provide a command that produces a description of the elaboration 
order for a partition upon request from the user. It is also acceptable 
to provide cross references to existing documentation (for example, a 
hardware manual), where appropriate.</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">19.b</DIV>

could conform to the Standard (but not to the Annex) if it supported 
only 12 values. Since the rules of the language require Constraint_Error
