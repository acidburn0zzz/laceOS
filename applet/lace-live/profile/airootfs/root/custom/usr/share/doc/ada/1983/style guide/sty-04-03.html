<H3><a name="4.3">4.3     Exceptions</a></H3>
This section addresses the issue of exceptions in the context of program 
structures. It discusses how exceptions should be used as part of the 
interface to a unit, including what exceptions to declare and raise and under 
what conditions to raise them. Information on how to handle, propagate, and 
avoid raising exceptions is found in <a href="sty-05-08.html#5.8">Guideline 5.8</a>.  Guidelines on how to deal 
with portability issues are in <a href="sty-07-05.html#7.5">Guideline 7.5</a>.<P>

<UL>
<li>Declare a different exception name for each error that the user of a  
unit can make. 
<li>Declare a different exception name for each unavoidable and  
unrecoverable internal error which can occur in a unit.  
<li>Do not borrow an exception name from another context.

can be raised.

corrected within the unit. 
<li>Do not raise the same exception to report different types of errors  
which are distinguishable by the user of the unit. 
<li> 	Provide interrogative functions which allow the user of a unit to 
avoid causing exceptions to be raised. 
<li>When possible, avoid changing state information in a unit before  
raising an exception.

<H4>example</H4>
This package specification defines an exception which enhances the abstraction:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
generic 
   type Element is private; 
package Stack is

   function Stack_Empty return Boolean;
   
   -- Raised when POP is used on empty stack. 
   No_Data_On_Stack : exception;
   
   procedure Pop  (From_Top :    out Element); 
   procedure Push (Onto_Top : in     Element);
   
end Stack; 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
This example shows how to convert a predefined exception to a user-defined one:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>   ... 
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   procedure Pop (From_Top :    out Element) is 
      ...
      
      if Stack_Empty then 
          raise No_Data_On_Stack;
   
      else -- Stack contains at least one element 
          Top_Index := Top_Index - 1; 
          From_Top  := Stack(Top_Index + 1);
   
      end if; 
   end Pop;
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   ...</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
Exceptions should be used as part of an abstraction to indicate error 
conditions which the abstraction is unable to prevent or correct. Since the 
abstraction is unable to correct such an error, it must report the error to 
the user. In the case of a usage error (e.g., attempting to invoke operations 
in the wrong sequence or attempting to exceed a boundary condition), the user 
may be able to correct the error. In the case of an error beyond the control 
of the user, the user may be able to work around the error if there are 
multiple mechanisms available to perform the desired operation. In other 
cases, the user may have to abandon use of the unit, dropping into a degraded 
mode of limited functionality. In any case, the user must be notified.<P>
Exceptions are a good mechanism for reporting such errors because they provide  
an alternate flow of control for dealing with errors. This allows  
error-handling code to be kept separate from the code for normal processing. 
When an exception is raised, the current operation is aborted and control is  
transferred directly to the appropriate exception handler.<P>
Several of the guidelines above exist to maximize the ability of the user to 
distinguish and correct different types of errors. Providing a different 
exception name for each error condition makes it possible to handle each error 
condition separately. Declaring new exception names, rather than raising 
exceptions declared in other packages, reduces the coupling between packages 
and also makes different exceptions more distinguishable. Exporting the names 
of all exceptions which a unit can raise, rather than declaring them 
internally to the unit, makes it possible for users of the unit to refer to 
the names in exception handlers. Otherwise, the user would be able to handle 
the exception only with an <CODE>others</CODE> handler. Finally, using comments to document 
exactly which of the exceptions declared in a package can be raised by each 
subprogram or task entry making it possible for the user to know which 
exception handlers are appropriate in each situation.<P>
Because they cause an immediate transfer of control, exceptions are useful for 
reporting unrecoverable errors which prevent an operation from being 
completed, but not for reporting status or modes incidental to the completion 
of an operation. They should not be used to report internal errors which a 
unit was able to correct invisibly to the user.<P>
To provide the user with maximum flexibility, it is a good idea to provide  
interrogative functions which the user can call to determine whether an  
exception would be raised if a subprogram or task entry were invoked. The  
function <CODE>Stack_Empty</CODE> in the above example is such a function. It indicates  
whether <CODE>No_Data_On_Stack</CODE> would be raised if <CODE>Pop</CODE> were called.  Providing such  
functions makes it possible for the user to avoid triggering exceptions.<P>
To support error recovery by its user, a unit should try to avoid changing  
state during an invocation which raises an exception. If a requested operation  
cannot be completely and correctly performed, then the unit should either  
detect this before changing any internal state information, or should revert  
back to the state at the time of the request. For example, after raising the  
exception <CODE>No_Data_On_Stack</CODE>, the stack package in the above example should  
remain in exactly the same state it was in when <CODE>Pop</CODE> was called. If it were to  
partially update its internal data structures for managing the stack, then  
future <CODE>Push</CODE> and <CODE>Pop</CODE> operations would not perform correctly. This is always  
desirable, but not always possible.<P>
User-defined exceptions should be used instead of predefined or 
compiler-defined exceptions because they are more descriptive and more specific 
to the abstraction. The predefined exceptions are very general, and can be  
triggered by many different situations. Compiler-defined exceptions are 
nonportable and have meanings which are subject to change even between  
successive releases of the same compiler. This introduces too much uncertainty  
for the creation of useful handlers.<P>
If you are writing an abstraction, remember that the user does not know about  
the units you use in your implementation. That is an effect of information  
hiding. If any exception is raised within your abstraction, you must catch it  
and handle it. The user is not able to provide a reasonable handler if the  
original exception is allowed to propagate out. You can still convert the  
exception into a form intelligible to the user if your abstraction cannot  
effectively recover on its own.<P>
Converting an exception means raising a user-defined exception in the handler 
for the original exception. This introduces a meaningful name for export to 
the user of the unit. Once the error situation is couched in terms of the 
application, it can be handled in those terms.<P>
Do not allow an exception to propagate unhandled outside the scope of the  
declaration of its name, because then only a handler for <CODE>others</CODE> can catch it.  
As discussed under <a href="sty-05-08.html#5.8.2">Guideline 5.8.2</a>, a handler for <CODE>others</CODE> cannot be written to deal  
with the specific error effectively.<P>
