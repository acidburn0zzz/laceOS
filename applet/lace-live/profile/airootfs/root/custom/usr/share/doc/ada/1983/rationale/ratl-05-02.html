<H2>CHAPTER 5: Numeric Types</H2>

<H3><a name="5.2">5.2 The Integer Types</a></H3>

The operations predefined for the integer types are:

<tr><td>
<table><tr><td><pre>

<p>
New integer  subtypes declared  by  imposing  constraints  on  INTEGER
inherit these  operations: relational  operators deliver  a result  of
type BOOLEAN;  all others  deliver a  result of  the same  type as the
operands. Both  operands of  the binary  operators must  have the same
type, excepting  exponentiation, for  which the  right operand type is
always INTEGER.  If system-defined  integer types such as LONG_INTEGER
are implemented,  then overloadings  of the  arithmetic and relational
operators are  defined for  these types  in an  analogous manner;  and
similarly for SHORT_INTEGER, if implemented.
<p>
The user  can define  an integer  type by  specifying the  range to be
covered, for example
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type PAGE_NUM   is range 1 .. 2000;
type MY_INTEGER is range -100_000 .. 100_000;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
in which  case the  implementation will  use whichever predefined type
just encompasses  this range.  Thus MY_INTEGER would be implemented as
(a subtype  of a  type derived  from) LONG_INTEGER on a typical 16-bit
minicomputer, but  as INTEGER  on a  machine with  larger word length.
Portability of the program is thus assured, in this respect.
<p>
Furthermore, a  range constraint  can be  applied to  a type to give a
subtype. The  subtype has all the operations of the base type, but the
value of  any variable  of the subtype must always be within the range
of the subtype; in general this is checked before assigning a value to
the variable.  One would expect compilers to represent subtypes in the
same way  as types,  but in  special cases the compiler may be able to
optimize the  representation by  utilizing the  range constraint. Thus
the subtype
<p>
<PRE>    subtype SIGN is INTEGER range  -1 .. 1;</PRE>
<p>
contains only  three values,  so that each value could be stored using
one byte, or even two bits.
<p>
The operations  /, mod,  and rem  require  explanation.  There  is  no
universal agreement  on the semantics of these operations for negative
operand values.  Because different  machines perform  these operations
differently, it  is tempting  not to  define them for negative values.
This is  the approach  taken in the axiomatic definition of Pascal <a href="ratl-BIB.html">[HW
73]</a>. The  semantics chosen in the Ada language corresponds to division
with truncation  toward zero  (so (-3)/2 = -1). This has the advantage
that it preserves the identity:
<p>
<PRE>    -(A/B) = (-A)/B = A/(-B)</PRE>
<p>
The operations / and rem are related by
<p>
<PRE>    A = (A/B)&#42;B + (A rem B)</PRE>
<p>
so that  rem provides  the remainder on division. As a consequence the
sign of  the result  of the rem operation is therefore the same as the
sign of A (hence A rem 10 can be negative). Also the absolute value of
the result of the rem operation is less than the absolute value of B.
<p>
The operation  mod on  the other  hand is  defined so  that (A  mod B)
always has  the same sign as B and its absolute value is less than the
absolute value of B; subject to these conditions it must differ from A
by an  integer multiple  of B,  that is,  for some  integer value N it
satisfies the relation
<p>
<PRE>    A = B&#42;N + (A mod B)</PRE>
<p>
Integer exponentiation  is defined  only  for  nonnegative  exponents.
Hence, I&#42;&#42;(-1)  will raise  CONSTRAINT_ERROR as  the exponent  is  not
positive. The  operation is  defined as repeated multiplication of the
left hand  operand. The number of multiplications is one less than the
exponent value, so I&#42;&#42;2 = I&#42;I and I&#42;&#42;4 = I&#42;I&#42;I&#42;I.
<p>
The predefined  operator abs yields the absolute value of its operand,
and is defined for all numeric types.
