<H2>CHAPTER 3: Classical Programming</H2>

<H3><a name="3.5">3.5 Aggregates</a></H3>

For an  array or  record type,  Ada provides  a basic  operation  that
combines component  values into  a composite  value of  the type. This
basic operation  is expressed  by  an  aggregate  and  there  are  two
possible syntaxes for this construct.
<p>
The first  is  the  traditional  positional  notation,  in  which  the
composite value is defined by an ordered sequence of component values:
each value  is implicitly  associated with  the component that has the
same position in the array or record.
<p>
The second  - and  often preferable  - notation provided in Ada is the
so-called named  notation, in  which the  component-value pairings are
given explicitly by component associations of the form
<p>
<PRE>    component =&gt; value
</PRE><p>
using the names of the components (in the simplest case).
<p>
The examples  given below  show that named notation is often much more
readable than  positional notation,  since  it  allows  more  explicit
formulation of the intent. It is also more reliable, being insensitive
to order and permutation. Consider for example the following type:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
type DATE is
  record
    MONTH  :  INTEGER range 1 .. 12;
    DAY    :  INTEGER range 1 .. 31;
    YEAR   :  INTEGER range 1 .. 3000;
  end record;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Then we can define dates by positional aggregates such as
<p>
<PRE>    (12, 4, 1983)
</PRE><p>
but we  can express  our intent in a more explicit way if we use named
notation as in the three equivalent aggregates given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
(MONTH  =&gt;  12,       DAY   =&gt;  4,        YEAR =&gt;  1983) -- the American way
(DAY    =&gt;  4, MONTH  =&gt;  12,     YEAR    =&gt;  1983)      -- the European way
(YEAR   =&gt;  1983,     MONTH =&gt;  12,       DAY  =&gt;  4)    -- the IS0 way
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A reformulation  of the  type DATE is possible in which an enumeration
type is used for months. In that case a permutation error such as
<p>
<PRE>    (4, DECEMBER, 1983)
</PRE><p>
would be detected by a compiler. In the above all-integer formulation,
however, the  named notation  is more  reliable since the meaning does
not rely on order.
<p>
Similar possibilities exist for an array type such as
<p>
<PRE>    type TABLE is array (1 .. 10) of INTEGER;
</PRE><p>
Given the object declaration
<p>
<PRE>    T :  TABLE;
</PRE><p>
we can assign to T a positional array aggregate such as
<p>
<PRE>    T :=  (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
</PRE><p>
But the  intent can  be made more explicit by writing the aggregate in
any of the equivalent named forms given below
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
(1 .. 10 =&gt;  0)
(TABLE'FIRST .. TABLE'LAST =&gt;  0)
(T'FIRST .. T'LAST =&gt;  0)
(TABLE'RANGE =&gt;  0)
(T'RANGE =&gt;  0)
(others =&gt;  0)
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Other forms  of named notation allow the explicit mention of component
indexes, as in the following example
<p>
<PRE>    (1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 =&gt; 0,   2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 =&gt; 1)
</PRE><p>
Other examples  of aggregates  will be  presented in <a href="ratl-04.html#4">Chapter 4</a> when we
discuss overloading resolution for aggregates.
