The data structuring capabilities of Ada are a powerful resource; therefore, 
use them to model the data as closely as possible. It is possible to group 
logically related data and let the language control the abstraction and 
operations on the data rather than requiring the programmer or maintainer to 
do so. Data can also be organized in a building block fashion. In addition to 
showing how a data structure is organized (and possibly giving the reader an 
indication as to why it was organized that way), creating the data structure 
from smaller components allows those components to be reused themselves. Using 
the features that Ada provides can increase the maintainability of your code.

<li>Use records to group heterogeneous but related data. 
<li>Consider records to map to I/O device data.

<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Propulsion_Method is (Sail, Diesel, Nuclear);

type Craft is 
   record 
      Name   : Common_Name; 
      Plant  : Propulsion_Method; 
      Length : Feet; 
      Beam   : Feet; 
      Draft  : Feet; 
   end record;
   
type Fleet is array (1 .. Fleet_Size) of Craft;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
You help the maintainer find all of the related data by gathering it into the  
same construct, simplifying any modifications that apply to all rather than  
part. This in turn increases reliability. Neither you nor an unknown maintainer  
are liable to forget to deal with all the pieces of information in the  
executable statements, especially if updates are done with aggregate  
assignments whenever possible.<P>
The idea is to put the information a maintainer needs to know where it can be 
found with the minimum of effort. For example, if all information relating to 
a given <CODE>Craft</CODE> is in the same place, the relationship is clear both in the 
declarations and especially in the code accessing and updating that 
information. But, if it is scattered among several data structures, it is less 
obvious that this is an intended relationship as opposed to a coincidental 
one.  In the latter case, the declarations may be grouped together to imply 
intent, but it may not be possible to group the accessing and updating code 
that way.  Ensuring the use of the same index to access the corresponding 
element in each of several parallel arrays is difficult if the accesses are at 
all scattered.<P>
If the application must interface directly to hardware, the use of records,  
especially in conjunction with record representation clauses, could be useful  
to map onto the layout of the hardware in question.

<H4>note</H4>
It may seem desirable to store heterogeneous data in parallel arrays in what  
amounts to a FORTRAN-like style. This style is an artifact of FORTRAN's data 
structuring limitations. FORTRAN only has facilities for constructing  
homogeneous arrays. Ada's variant record types offer one way to specify what  
are called nonhomogeneous arrays or heterogeneous arrays.

<H4>exceptions</H4>
If the application must interface directly to hardware, and the hardware  
requires that information be distributed among various locations, then it may  
not be possible to use records.<P>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Record structures should not always be flat. Factor out common parts. 
<li>For a large record structure, group related components into smaller  
subrecords. 
<li>For nested records, pick element names that read well when inner  
elements are referenced. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>type Coordinate is 
   record 
      Row    : Local_Float; 
      Column : Local_Float; 
   end record;
   
type Window is 
   record 
      Top_Left     : Coordinate; 
      Bottom_Right : Coordinate; 
   end record;</pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>rationale</H4>
You can make complex data structures understandable and comprehensible by 
composing them of familiar building blocks. This technique works especially 
well for large record types with parts which fall into natural groupings. The 
components factored into separately declared records, based on a common 
quality or purpose, correspond to a lower level of abstraction than that 
represented by the larger record.

<H4>note</H4>
A carefully chosen name for the component of the larger record that is used to  
select the smaller enhances readability, for example: 
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>if Window1.Bottom_Right.Row &gt; Window2.Top_Left.Row then . . . </pre></td></tr></table>

<H4>guideline</H4>
<UL>
<li>Differentiate between static and dynamic data. Use dynamically  
allocated objects with caution. 
<li>Use dynamically allocated data structures only when it is necessary to  
create and destroy them dynamically or to be able to reference them by  
different names. 
<li>Do not drop pointers to undeallocated objects. 
<li>Do not leave dangling references to deallocated objects. 
<li>Initialize all access variables and components within a record. 
<li>Do not rely on memory deallocation. 
<li>Deallocate explicitly. 
<li>Use length clauses to specify total allocation size. 
<li>Provide handlers for <CODE>Storage_Error</CODE>. 
</UL>

<H4>example</H4>
These lines show how a dangling reference might be created:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>P1 := new Object; 
P2 := P1; 
Unchecked_Object_Deallocation(P2);</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
This line can raise an exception due to referencing the deallocated object:
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>X := P1.all;</pre></td></tr></table>
<P>
In the following three lines, if there is no intervening assignment of the  
value of <CODE>P1</CODE> to any other pointer, the object created on the first line is no  
longer accessible after the third line. The only pointer to the allocated  
object has been dropped.
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>P1 := new Object; 
... 
P1 := P2;</pre></td></tr></table>

See also Guidelines <a href="sty-05-09.html#5.9.1">5.9.1</a>, <a href="sty-05-09.html#5.9.2">5.9.2</a>, and <a href="sty-06-01.html#6.1.3">6.1.3</a> for variations on these problems. A dynamically 
allocated object is an object created by the execution of an allocator 
(&quot;new&quot;).  Allocated objects referenced by access variables allow you to 
generate aliases, which are multiple references to the same object. Anomalous 
behavior can arise when you reference a deallocated object by another name. 
This is called a dangling reference. Totally disassociating a still-valid 
object from all names is called dropping a pointer. A dynamically allocated 
object that is not associated with a name cannot be referenced or explicitly 
deallocated.<P>
A dropped pointer depends on an implicit memory manager for reclamation of 
space. It also raises questions for the reader as to whether the loss of 
access to the object was intended or accidental.<P>
An Ada environment is not required to provide deallocation of dynamically  
allocated objects. If provided, it may be provided implicitly (objects are  
deallocated when their access type goes out of scope), explicitly (objects are  
deallocated when <CODE>Unchecked_Deallocation</CODE> is called), or both. To increase the  
likelihood of the storage space being reclaimed, it is best to call  
<CODE>Unchecked_Deallocation</CODE> explicitly for each dynamically object when you are  
finished using it. Calls to <CODE>Unchecked_Deallocation</CODE> also document a deliberate  
decision to abandon an object, making the code easier to read and understand.  
To be absolutely certain that space is reclaimed and reused, manage your own  
&quot;free list.&quot; Keep track of which objects you are finished with, and reuse them 
instead of dynamically allocating new objects later.<P>
The dangers of dangling references are that you may attempt to use them, 
thereby accessing memory which you have released to the memory manager, and 
which may have been subsequently allocated for another purpose in another part 
of your program. When you read from such memory, unexpected errors may occur 
because the other part of your program may have previously written totally 
unrelated data there. Even worse, when you write to such memory you can cause 
errors in an apparently unrelated part of the code by changing values of 
variables dynamically allocated by that code. This type of error can be very 
difficult to find. Finally, such errors may be triggered in parts of your 
environment that you didn't write, for example, in the memory management 
system itself which may dynamically allocate memory to keep records about your 
dynamically allocated memory.<P>
Keep in mind that any uninitialized or unreset component of a record or array  
can also be a dangling reference or carry a bit pattern representing  
inconsistent data. <P>
Whenever you use dynamic allocation it is possible to run out of space. Ada  
provides a facility (a length clause) for requesting the size of the pool of  
allocation space at compile time. Anticipate that you can still run out at run  
time. Prepare handlers for the exception <CODE>Storage_Error</CODE>, and consider carefully  
what alternatives you may be able to include in the program for each such  
situation.<P>
There is a school of thought that dictates avoidance of all dynamic 
allocation.  It is largely based on the fear of running out of memory during 
execution.  Facilities such as length clauses and exception handlers for 
<CODE>Storage_Error</CODE> provide explicit control over memory partitioning and error 
recovery, making this fear unfounded.<P>
