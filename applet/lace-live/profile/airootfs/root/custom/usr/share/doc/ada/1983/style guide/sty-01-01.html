<h3><a name="1.1">1.1     How To Use This Book</a></H3>

There are a number of ways in which this book can be used: as a reference on 
good Ada style; as a comprehensive list of guidelines which will contribute to 
better Ada programs; or as a reference work to consult about using specific 
features of the language. The book contains many guidelines, some of which are 
quite complex. Learning them all at the same time should not be necessary; it 
is unlikely that you will be using all the features of the language at once. 
However, it is recommended that all programmers (and, where possible, other 
Ada project staff) make an effort to read and understand Chapters<a href="sty-02.html"> 2</a>,<a href="sty-03.html"> 3</a>, and<a href="sty-04.html"> 4</a> 
and <a href="sty-05.html">Chapter 5</a> up to <a href="sty-05-07.html#5.7">Section 5.7</a>. Some of the material is quite difficult (for 
example, <a href="sty-04-02.html#4.2">Section 4.2</a> which discusses visibility), but it covers issues which 
are fundamental to the effective use of Ada and is important for any software 
professional involved in building Ada systems.
<P>
The remainder of the book covers relatively specific issues. Exceptions and 
erroneous execution is covered at the end of <a href="sty-05.html">Chapter 5</a>; and tasking, 
portability, and reuse is covered in Chapters<a href="sty-06.html"> 6</a>,<a href="sty-07.html"> 7</a>, and<a href="sty-08.html"> 8</a> respectively. You 
should be aware of the content of this part of the book. You may be required 
to follow the guidelines presented in it, but you could defer more detailed 
study until needed. Meanwhile, it can serve as useful reference material about 
specific Ada features; for example, the discussion of floating point numbers 
in the <a href="sty-07.html">chapter on portability</a>.
<P>
This book is not intended as an introductory text on Ada or as a complete  
manual of the Ada language. It is assumed that you already know the syntax of  
Ada and have a rudimentary understanding of the semantics. With such a  
background, you should find the guidelines useful, informative, and often  
enlightening.
<P>
If you are learning Ada you should equip yourself with a comprehensive 
introduction to the language such as Barnes (1989) or Cohen (1986). The <a href="http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/">Ada Language Reference Manual</a> (Department of Defense 1983) should be regarded as a 
crucial companion to this book. The majority of guidelines reference the 
sections of the Ada Language Reference Manual that define the language 
features being discussed. <a href="sty-A.html">Appendix A</a> cross references sections of the Ada 
Language Reference Manual to the guidelines.
<i>[NOTE: Cross references from Appendix A of the original Style Guide
appear as sets of live HTML links at the end of applicable subsections
in this HTML version of the Style Guide and in the
companion HTML version of the '83 Language Reference Manual.]</i>
<P>
Throughout the book, references are given to other sources of information 
about Ada style and other Ada issues. The references are listed at the end of 
the book, followed by a bibliography which includes them and other relevant 
sources consulted during the book's preparation.
