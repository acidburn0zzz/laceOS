<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.8">15.8 Unchecked Conversions</a></H3>

The conversions  allowed between  numeric types and between types that
are derived  from each  other are safe conversions that do not violate
the rules of type checking.
<p>
Unchecked type  conversions can  be  achieved  in  any  language  that
permits code  insertions or address clauses. Such conversions may, for
example, be  needed if  a user  wants to  define  his  own  allocation
strategy for  access types.  In this case, conversions from integer to
access values  are necessary  to define  an ALLOCATE  procedure and  a
converse FREE procedure.
<p>
From the  point  of  view  of  programming  management  (and  also  of
maintainability) it  is desirable to provide a standard way to achieve
such unchecked  conversions. In  this way  the parts of a program that
use such dangerous features are made easier to identify. The following
generic library function is predefined to that effect.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
generic
  type SOURCE    is limited private;
  type TARGET    is limited private;
function UNCHECKED_CONVERSION(S  :   SOURCE) return  TARGET;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
A  program
unit that  uses unchecked  type conversions  must mention this generic
function in  its with  clauses. A  possible scenario is indicated with
the package LIST_HANDLING given below:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=6><tr><td><pre>
package LIST_HANDLING is
  type PLACE;
  type LIST is access PLACE;

  type PLACE is
    record
      SUCC, PRED :  LIST;
      VALUE      :  INTEGER;
    end record;
  ...
  procedure ALLOCATE  (X :  out LIST);
  procedure FREE   (X :  in out LIST);
  ...
  pragma CONTROLLED(LIST);        -- no garbage collection
  for LIST'STORAGE_SIZE use 0;    -- new will not be usable
 end;

with UNCHECKED_CONVERSION;
package body LIST_HANDLING is
  function INT_TO_LIST is
    new UNCHECKED_CONVERSION(SOURCE =&gt;  INTEGER,
                         TARGET =&gt;  LIST);
  ...
  procedure ALLOCATE(X :  out LIST) is
    ADDRESS :  INTEGER;
  begin
    ...
    -- Compute address, Then:
    X :=  INT_TO_LIST(ADDRESS);
  end;
  ...
end LIST_HANDLING;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The function  INT_TO_LIST is obtained within the body of LIST_HANDLING
by instantiation  of UNCHECKED_CONVERSION,  and is  used to convert an
integer address into a LIST.
<p>
The programming  environment may  be able  to control and restrict the
programs  that   are  allowed   to  get   access   to   the   function
UNCHECKED_CONVERSION.
