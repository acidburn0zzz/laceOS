<H1>8.2 Scope of Declarations</H1>
<DIV Class="paranum">1</DIV>
<DIV Class="Normal">[For each declaration, the language rules define 
a certain portion of the program text called the <I>scope</I> of the 
declaration. The scope of a declaration is also called the scope of any 
view or entity declared by the declaration. Within the scope of an entity, 
and only there, there are places where it is legal to refer to the declared 
entity. These places are defined by the rules of visibility and overloading.]

scope (of a declaration)</I>}</SPAN> <A NAME="I3695"></A>The <I>immediate 
scope</I> of a declaration is a portion of the declarative region immediately 
enclosing the declaration. The immediate scope starts at the beginning 
of the declaration, except in the case of an overloadable declaration, 
in which case the immediate scope starts just after the place where the 
profile of the callable entity is determined (which is at the end of 
the <SPAN Class="swiss">_specification</SPAN> for the callable entity, 
or at the end of the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-12-3.html#S0257">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN> 
if an instance). The immediate scope extends to the end of the declarative 
region, with the following exceptions:&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV Class="paranum">2.a</DIV>
<DIV Class="Annotations"><B>Reason:&nbsp;</B>The reason for making overloadable 
declarations with profiles special is to simplify compilation: until 
the compiler has determined the profile, it doesn't know which other 
declarations are homographs of this one, so it doesn't know which ones 
this one should hide. Without this rule, two passes over the <SPAN Class="swiss">_specification</SPAN> 
or <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-12-3.html#S0257">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN>

said that within a subprogram specification and within the formal part 
of an entry declaration or accept statement, all declarations with the 
same designator as the subprogram or entry were hidden from all visibility. 
The RM83-8.3(16) rule seemed to be overkill, and created both implementation

private parts, thus requiring us to be able to talk about the visible 
part as well. It was necessary to extend the concept to subprograms and 
to generic units, in order for the visibility rules related to child 
library units to work properly. It was necessary to define the concept 
separately for generic formal packages, since their visible part is slightly 
different from that of a normal package. Extending the concept to composite 
types made the definition of scope slightly simpler. We define visible 
part for some things elsewhere, since it makes a big difference to the 
user for those things. For composite types and subprograms, however, 
the concept is used only in arcane visibility rules, so we localize it
