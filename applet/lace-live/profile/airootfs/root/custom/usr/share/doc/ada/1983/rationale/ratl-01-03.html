contributions of  several others  to the  Ada Rationale:  Jean-Raymond
Abrial, Bernd Krieg-Brueckner, Jean-Claude Heliard, Henry Ledgard, Ian
Pyle, Olivier  Roubine, Steve Schuman, Stan Vestal, and Brian Wichmann
contributed to the 1978 and 1979 initial versions. Brian Wichmann also

Other significant  contributions were  derived from the Language Study
Notes by  Jean-Loup Gailly and Paul Hilfinger and by comments from the
Distinguished Reviewers.
