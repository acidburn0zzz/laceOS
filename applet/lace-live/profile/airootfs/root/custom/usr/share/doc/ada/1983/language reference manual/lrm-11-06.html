<P>
The purpose of this section is to specify the  conditions  under  which  an
implementation  is  allowed  to  perform  certain actions either earlier or
later than specified by other rules of the language. 
<P>
In general, when the language rules specify an order  for  certain  actions
(the  canonical order), an implementation may only use an alternative order
if it can guarantee that the effect of the program is not  changed  by  the
reordering.   In particular, no exception should arise for the execution of
the reordered program if none arises for the execution of  the  program  in
the canonical order.  When, on the other hand, the order of certain actions
is   not   defined   by  the  language,  any  order  can  be  used  by  the
implementation.  (For example, the arguments of a predefined  operator  can
be  evaluated  in  any   order  since the rules given in section <a href="lrm-04-05.html#4.5">4.5</a> do not
require a specific order of evaluation.) 
<P>
Additional freedom is left to  an  implementation  for  reordering  actions
involving  predefined  operations  that  are either predefined operators or
basic operations other than assignments.  This freedom is left, as  defined
below,  even in the case where the execution of these predefined operations
may propagate a (predefined) exception: 
<ol>
<li>For the purpose of establishing whether the same effect is obtained by
the  execution  of  certain  actions  in  the  canonical  and  in   an
alternative  order,  it  can  be  assumed  that none of the predefined
operations  invoked  by  these  actions  propagates   a   (predefined)
exception, provided that the two following requirements are met by the
alternative  order:   first,  an  operation must not be invoked in the   
alternative order if  it  is  not  invoked  in  the  canonical  order;
second,  for  each  operation, the innermost enclosing frame or accept
statement must be  the  same  in  the  alternative  order  as  in  the
canonical order, and the same exception handlers must apply.<br><br> 
<li>Within an expression, the association of operators  with  operands  is
specified  by  the  syntax.   However,  for  a  sequence of predefined
operators of  the  same  precedence  level  (and  in  the  absence  of
parentheses  imposing  a  specific  association),  any  association of
operators with operands is  allowed  if  it  satisfies  the  following
requirement:   an  integer  result  must be equal to that given by the
canonical left-to-right order;  a  real  result  must  belong  to  the
result  model  interval  defined for the canonical left-to-right order
(see <a href="lrm-04-05.html#4.5.7">4.5.7</a>).  Such a reordering is allowed even if it  may  remove  an
exception, or introduce a further predefined exception. 
</ol>
Similarly,  additional  freedom  is  left  to  an  implementation  for  the
evaluation  of  numeric  simple  expressions.   For  the  evaluation  of  a  
predefined  operation, an implementation is allowed to use the operation of
a type that has a range wider than that of the base type of  the  operands,
provided  that  this  delivers  the  exact  result  (or a result within the
declared accuracy, in the case of a real type), even if  some  intermediate
results   lie   outside   the  range  of  the  base  type.   The  exception
NUMERIC_ERROR need not be raised in such a case.   In  particular,  if  the
numeric  expression  is an operand of a predefined relational operator, the
exception NUMERIC_ERROR need  not  be  raised  by  the  evaluation  of  the
relation, provided that the correct BOOLEAN result is obtained.   
<P>
A preedefined  operation  need  not be invoked at all, if its only possible
effect is to propagate a predefined  exception.   Similarly,  a  predefined
operation  need  not  be invoked if the removal of subsequent operations by
the above rule renders this invocation ineffective. 
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
Rule (b) applies to predefined  operators  but  not  to  the  short-circuit
control forms. 
<P>
The  expression SPEED &lt; 300_000.0  can  be replaced by TRUE if the value
300_000.0 lies outside the base type of SPEED,  even  though  the  implicit
conversion  of the numeric literal would raise the exception NUMERIC_ERROR. 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    declare
       N : INTEGER;
    begin
       N := 0;               --  (1)
       for J in 1 .. 10 loop
          N := N + J**A(K);  --  A and K are global variables
       end loop;
       PUT(N);
    exception
       when others =&gt; PUT("Some error arose"); PUT(N);
    end; 
</pre>
<P>
The evaluation of A(K) may be  performed  before  the  loop,  and  possibly
immediately before the assignment statement (1) even if this evaluation can
raise  an exception.  Consequently, within the exception handler, the value
of N is either the undefined initial value or a value later  assigned.   On
the  other  hand, the evaluation of A(K) cannot be moved before begin since
an exception would then be  handled  by  a  different  handler.   For  this
reason, the initialization of N in the declaration itself would exclude the
possibility of having an undefined initial value of N in the handler.
