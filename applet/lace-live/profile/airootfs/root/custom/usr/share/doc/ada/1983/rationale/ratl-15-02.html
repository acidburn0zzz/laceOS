<H2>CHAPTER 15: Representation Clauses and Machine Dependences</H2>

<H3><a name="15.2">15.2 Types and Data Representation</a></H3>

In a  typed language,  it is  important  to  associate  representation
clauses with  types rather  than with  individual objects.  The  basic
reasons are  simplicity and  uniformity. To  associate  representation
clauses with  individual objects could mean that these clauses have to
be duplicated  in many separate declarations and it might therefore be
difficult  to   maintain  consistency,   especially   after   repeated
modification.
<p>
Alternatively, it  could mean  that a  name is  associated  with  each
possible representation;  and that  each object  declaration  mentions
both a  type name  and a  representation name. However such a solution
would result  in less  readable programs. For these reasons, a simpler
solution is  used in  Ada: a representation is associated with a type.
Associating representation  with type  localizes this specification in
one place. The specification is thereby associated with all objects of
the given type (constants, variables, formal parameters, and so on).
<p>
A further  advantage of  this approach  is that,  while every type has
some representation,  the user  need not  always be concerned with it.
Explicit (user-defined)  representation clauses  are optional: in most
cases we  are quite  willing to  let the  compiler select an efficient
representation for  types.  This  is  what  we  normally  expect  from
compilers although  no particular  default is  guaranteed, so  that  a
small change  of a  declaration may  sometimes be  reflected by a more
significant change  of representation.  In certain  cases, however, we
want to  regain control:  not because we do not trust the compiler but
because we  know some  information that is essential for the selection
of a  representation. For  example we  might know that a given logical
type is  associated with an external hardware interface, in which case
we would  write a  representation clause  to adopt  the representation
that is  dictated by the hardware and thus override any default choice
made by the compiler.
<p>
Representation clauses  may be more or less restrictive; in some cases
they fully  specify the  mapping, while  in other  cases  they  merely
specify some aspects of a representation.
