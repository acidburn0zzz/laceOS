<P>
An  aggregate  is  a  basic operation that combines component values into a
composite value of a record or array type. 
<pre>
    aggregate ::=
       (component_association {, component_association}) 

    component_association ::=
       [choice {| choice} =&gt; ] expression 
</pre>
<P>
Each  component  association  associates  an  expression  with   components
(possibly  none).   A  component  association  is  said  to be named if the
components are specified explicitly by choices;  it is otherwise said to be
positional.  For  a  positional  association,  the  (single)  component  is
implicitly  specified  by  position,  in  the  order  of  the corresponding
component declarations for record components,  in  index  order  for  array
components. 
<P>
Named  associations  can  be  given  in  any  order  (except for the choice
others), but if both positional and named associations are used in the same
aggregate, then positional associations must occur first, at  their  normal
position.   Hence  once  a  named  association  is  used,  the  rest of the
aggregate must use only named associations.  Aggregates containing a single
component association must always be given  in  named  notation.   Specific
rules  concerning  component  associations  exist for record aggregates and
array aggregates. 
<P>
Choices in component associations have the same syntax as in variant  parts
(see <a href="lrm-03-07.html#3.7.3">3.7.3</a>).  A choice that is a component simple name is only allowed in a
record  aggregate.   For a component association, a choice that is a simple
expression or a discrete range is only allowed in an  array  aggregate;   a
choice  that  is  a  simple  expression  specifies  the  component  at  the
corresponding index  value;   similarly  a  discrete  range  specifies  the
components  at  the  index  values in the range.  The choice others is only
allowed in a component association if the association appears last and  has  
this single choice;  it specifies all remaining components, if any. 
<P>
Each  component  of  the  value defined by an aggregate must be represented
once and only once in the aggregate.  Hence each aggregate must be complete
and a given component is not allowed to  be  specified  by  more  than  one
choice. 
<P>
The  type  of  an aggregate must be determinable solely from the context in
which the aggregate appears, excluding the aggregate itself, but using  the
fact  that  this  type  must  be composite and not limited.  The type of an
aggregate in turn determines the required type for each of its  components.                                              
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The  above  rule implies that the determination of the type of an aggregate
cannot use any information from within the aggregate.  In particular,  this
determination  cannot  use  the  type  of  the  expression  of  a component
association, or the form or the type of a choice.  An aggregate can  always
be  distinguished  from  an  expression enclosed by parentheses:  this is a
consequence of the fact that named notation is required  for  an  aggregate
with a single component.

<P>
If the type of an aggregate is a record type, the component names given  as
choices  must  denote  components  (including  discriminants) of the record
type.  If the choice others is given as a choice of a record aggregate,  it
must  represent  at  least one component.  A component association with the
choice others or  with  more  than  one  choice  is  only  allowed  if  the
represented  components  are  all  of  the  same type.  The expression of a
component  association  must  have  the  type  of  the  associated   record
components. 
<P>
The  value specified for a discriminant that governs a variant part must be
given by a  static  expression  (note  that  this  value  determines  which
dependent components must appear in the record value). 
<P>
For  the  evaluation  of  a  record aggregate, the expressions given in the
component associations are evaluated in some order that is not  defined  by
the  language.  The expression of a named association is evaluated once for
each associated component.   A  check  is  made  that  the  value  of  each
subcomponent  of the aggregate belongs to the subtype of this subcomponent.
<P>
The exception CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised if this check fails. 
<P>
Example of a record aggregate with positional associations: 
<pre>
    (4, JULY, 1776)                      --  see <a href="lrm-03-07.html#3.7">3.7</a> 
</pre>
<P>
Examples of record aggregates with named associations: 
<pre>
    (DAY =&gt; 4, MONTH =&gt; JULY, YEAR =&gt; 1776)
    (MONTH =&gt; JULY, DAY =&gt; 4, YEAR =&gt; 1776) 

    (DISK, CLOSED, TRACK =&gt; 5, CYLINDER =&gt; 12)       --  see <a href="lrm-03-07.html#3.7.3">3.7.3</a>
    (UNIT =&gt; DISK, STATUS =&gt; CLOSED, CYLINDER =&gt; 9, TRACK =&gt; 1) 
</pre>
<P>
Example of component association with several choices:   
<pre>
    (VALUE =&gt; 0, SUCC|PRED =&gt; new CELL'(0, null, null))   --  see <a href="lrm-03-08.html#3.8.1">3.8.1</a>

    --  The allocator is evaluated twice:  SUCC and PRED designate
        different cells
</pre>
<P>
Note:    
<P>
For an aggregate with positional associations, discriminant  values  appear
first  since  the  discriminant  part  is  given  first  in the record type
declaration;  they must be in the same order as in the  discriminant  part.

<P>
If  the  type  of  an  aggregate is a one-dimensional array type, then each
choice must specify values of the index type, and the  expression  of  each
component association must be of the component type. 
<P>
If  the  type  of  an  aggregate  is  a  multidimensional  array  type,  an
n-dimensional aggregate is written as a one-dimensional aggregate, in which
the expression specified for each component association is  itself  written
as  an  (n-1)-dimensional  aggregate  which  is called a subaggregate;  the
index subtype of the one-dimensional aggregate is given by the first  index
position  of the array type.  The same rule is used to write a subaggregate
if it is again  multidimensional,  using  successive  index  positions.   A
string literal is allowed in a multidimensional aggregate at the place of a
one-dimensional  array  of  a  character  type.  In what follows, the rules 
concerning array aggregates are  formulated  in  terms  of  one-dimensional
aggregates. 
<P>
Apart from a final component association with the single choice others, the
rest  (if  any) of the component associations of an array aggregate must be
either all positional or all  named.   A  named  association  of  an  array
aggregate  is only allowed to have a choice that is not static, or likewise
a choice that is a null range, if the aggregate includes a single component
association and this component association has a single choice.  An  others
choice is static if the applicable index constraint is static. 
<P>
The  bounds  of an array aggregate that has an others choice are determined
by the applicable index constraint.  An others choice is  only  allowed  if
the  aggregate  appears in one of the following contexts (which defines the
applicable index constraint): 
<ol>
<li>The aggregate is an actual parameter, a generic actual parameter,  the
result  expression  of  a  function, or the expression that follows an
assignment  compound  delimiter.   Moreover,  the   subtype   of   the
corresponding  formal  parameter,  generic  formal parameter, function
result, or object is a constrained array subtype. 
<br><br>
For an aggregate that appears  in  such  a  context  and  contains  an
association  with an others choice, named associations are allowed for
other associations only in the case of a (nongeneric) actual parameter
or function result.  If the aggregate  is  a  multidimensional  array,
this restriction also applies to each of its subaggregates.    
<br><br>
<li>The aggregate is the operand of a qualified expression whose type mark
denotes a constrained array subtype. 
<br><br>
<li>The aggregate is the expression of the  component  association  of  an   
enclosing  (array  or  record) aggregate.  Moreover, if this enclosing
aggregate is a multidimensional array aggregate then it is  itself  in
one of these three contexts. 
</ol>
The  bounds  of  an array aggregate that does not have an others choice are
determined as follows.  For an aggregate that has named  associations,  the
bounds  are  determined  by  the smallest and largest choices given.  For a
positional aggregate, the lower bound is determined by the applicable index
constraint if the aggregate appears in one of the contexts (a) through (c);
otherwise, the lower bound is  given  by  S'FIRST  where  S  is  the  index
subtype;   in  either  case, the upper bound is determined by the number of
components.                                                                       
<P>
The evaluation of an array aggregate that is not a subaggregate proceeds in
two steps.  First, the choices of this aggregate and of its  subaggregates,
if  any,  are  evaluated in some order that is not defined by the language.
Second,  the  expressions  of  the  component  associations  of  the  array
aggregate  are evaluated in some order that is not defined by the language;
the expression of a named association is evaluated once for each associated
component.  The evaluation of a subaggregate consists of this  second  step
(the  first step is omitted since the choices have already been evaluated). 
<P>
For the evaluation of an aggregate that is not a null  array,  a  check  is
made  that  the index values defined by choices belong to the corresponding
index subtypes, and also  that  the  value  of  each  subcomponent  of  the
aggregate   belongs   to   the   subtype  of  this  subcomponent.   For  an
n-dimensional  multidimensional  aggregate,  a  check  is  made  that   all  
(n-1)-dimensional  subaggregates  have  the  same  bounds.   The  exception
CONSTRAINT_ERROR is raised if any of these checks fails.
<P>
Note: 
<P>
The allowed contexts for an array aggregate including an others choice  are
such  that  the  bounds  of  such  an  aggregate  are always known from the
context.

Examples of array aggregates with positional associations: 
<pre>
    (7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0)

    ((1.1, 1.2, 1.3), (2.1, 2.2, 2.3))
    (1 =&gt; (1.1, 1.2, 1.3), 2 =&gt; (2.1, 2.2, 2.3))
    (1 =&gt; (1 =&gt; 1.1, 2 =&gt; 1.2, 3 =&gt; 1.3), 2 =&gt; (1 =&gt; 2.1, 2 =&gt; 2.2, 3 =&gt; 2.3)) 
</pre>
<P>
Examples of aggregates as initial values: 
<pre>
  A : TABLE := (7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0);        -- A(1)=7, A(10)= 8
  B : TABLE := TABLE'(2 | 4 | 10 =&gt; 1, others =&gt; 0);  -- B(1)=0, B(10)=1
  C : constant MATRIX := (1 .. 5 =&gt; (1 .. 8 =&gt; 0.0));
                                                 -- C'FIRST(1)=1, C'LAST(2)=8

  D : BIT_VECTOR(M .. N) := (M .. N =&gt; TRUE);  -- see <a href="lrm-03-06.html#3.6">3.6</a>
  E : BIT_VECTOR(M .. N) := (others =&gt; TRUE);
  F : STRING(1 .. 1) := (1 =&gt; 'F');  -- a one component aggregate: same as "F"
