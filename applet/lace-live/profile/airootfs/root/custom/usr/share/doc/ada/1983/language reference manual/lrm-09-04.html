<H2><A NAME="9.4">9.4</A>.  Task Dependence - Termination of Tasks  </H2>
<A HREF="lrm-09-03.html#9.3"><img src="lrm-prev.gif" alt="[PREVIOUS]"></A><A HREF="lrm-09.html#9"><img src="lrm-up.gif" alt="[UP]"></A><A HREF="lrm-09-05.html#9.5"><img src="lrm-next.gif" alt="[NEXT]"></A>
<P>
Each task depends on at least one master.  A master is a construct that  is
either  a  task,  a currently executing block statement or subprogram, or a
library package (a package declared within another program unit  is  not  a
master).   The  dependence  on  a  master  is  a  direct  dependence in the
following two cases: 
<ol>
<li>The task designated by  a  task  object  that  is  the  object,  or  a
subcomponent  of the object, created by the evaluation of an allocator
depends on the master that elaborates the  corresponding  access  type
definition.<br><br> 
<li>The task designated by any other task object  depends  on  the  master
whose execution creates the task object. 
</ol>
Furthermore,  if a task depends on a given master that is a block statement
executed by another master, then  the  task  depends  also  on  this  other
master,  in  an  indirect  manner;  the same holds if the given master is a
subprogram called by another master, and if the given master is a task that
depends (directly or indirectly) on another master.  Dependences exist  for
objects  of  a  private  type  whose full declaration is in terms of a task
type. 
<P>
A task is said to have completed its execution when  it  has  finished  the
execution  of  the  sequence  of statements that appears after the reserved  
word  begin in the corresponding body.  Similarly a block or  a  subprogram
is  said to have completed its execution when it has finished the execution
of the corresponding sequence of statements.  For a  block  statement,  the
execution  is also said to be completed when it reaches an exit, return, or
goto statement transferring control out of the block.  For a procedure, the 
execution is  also  said  to  be  completed  when  a  corresponding  return
statement  is  reached.   For  a function, the execution is also said to be
completed after the  evaluation  of  the  result  expression  of  a  return
statement.  Finally the execution of a task, block statement, or subprogram
is  completed if an exception is raised by the execution of its sequence of
statements and there is no corresponding handler, or, if there is one, when
it has finished the execution of the corresponding handler.                                             
<P>
If a task has no dependent task, its termination takes place  when  it  has
completed  its  execution.   After  its  termination,  a task is said to be
terminated.  If a task has dependent tasks,  its  termination  takes  place
when  the  execution  of  the task is completed and all dependent tasks are
terminated.  A block  statement  or  subprogram  body  whose  execution  is
completed is not left until all of its dependent tasks are terminated. 
<P>
Termination  of  a  task otherwise takes place if and only if its execution
has reached an open  terminate  alternative  in  a  select  statement  (see
<a href="lrm-09-07.html#9.7.1">9.7.1</a>), and the following conditions are satisfied: 
<ul>
<li>The task depends on some master whose execution  is  completed  (hence
not a library package).<br><br> 
<li>Each task that depends on the  master  considered  is  either  already
terminated  or similarly waiting on an open terminate alternative of a
select statement. 
</ul>
<P>
When both conditions are satisfied, the task considered becomes terminated,
together with all tasks that depend on the master considered. 
<P>
Example: 
<pre>
    declare
       type GLOBAL is access RESOURCE;          --  see <a href="lrm-09-01.html#9.1">9.1</a>
       A, B : RESOURCE;
       G    : GLOBAL;
    begin
       --  activation of A and B
       declare
          type LOCAL is access RESOURCE;
          X : GLOBAL := new RESOURCE;  --  activation of X.all
          L : LOCAL  := new RESOURCE;  --  activation of L.all
          C : RESOURCE;
       begin
          --  activation of C
          G := X;  --  both G and X designate the same task object
          ...
       end;  --  await termination of C and L.all (but not X.all)
       ...
    end;  --  await termination of A, B, and G.all 
</pre>
<P>
Notes: 
<P>
The rules given for termination imply that all tasks that depend  (directly
or  indirectly)  on a given master and that are not already terminated, can
be terminated (collectively) if and only if each of them is waiting  on  an
open  terminate  alternative of a select statement and the execution of the
given master is completed. 
<P>
The usual rules apply to the main program.   Consequently,  termination  of
the  main  program  awaits  termination  of  any dependent task even if the
corresponding task type is declared in a library  package.   On  the  other
hand,  termination  of the main program does not await termination of tasks  
that depend on library packages;  the language does not define whether such
tasks are required to terminate. 
<P>
For an access type derived from  another  access  type,  the  corresponding
access  type  definition  is that of the parent type;  the dependence is on
the master that elaborates the ultimate parent access type definition.                                                   
<P>
A renaming declaration defines a new name for an existing entity and  hence
creates no further dependence.
